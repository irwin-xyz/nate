While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke... Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3389"],"name":["Stephen King"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"],"average_rating":["4.00"],"ratings_count":["9713981"],"text_reviews_count":["319123"]}]}],"published":["2011"]},{"id":[{"_":"10572","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0553381695"],"isbn13":["9780553381696"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"14433","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974m/10572.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974s/10572.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10572.A_Clash_of_Kings"],"num_pages":["761"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Bantam"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["575565"],"description":["Alternate cover edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6041689-a-clash-of-kings\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. <br /><br /><br />Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br /><br />As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. <br /><br />A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. <br /><br />Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. <br /><br />Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment;a tale of pure excitement you will never forget."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["346732"],"name":["George R.R.

Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.<br /><br />Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall. Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords..."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["346732"],"name":["George R.R.

It is a time when publishing is still largely a private affair—a scattered family of small houses here and in Europe—a time of gatherings in fabled apartments and conversations that continue long into the night. In this world of dinners, deals, and literary careers, Bowman finds that he fits in perfectly. But despite his success, what eludes him is love.

Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.<br /><br />They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["33919"],"name":["Jeff VanderMeer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1400594878p5/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1400594878p2/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33919.Jeff_VanderMeer"],"average_rating":["3.68"],"ratings_count":["113327"],"text_reviews_count":["14214"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"16278318","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804137250"],"isbn13":["9780804137256"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7384","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Armada"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428m/16278318.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428s/16278318.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada"],"num_pages":["349"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown Publishing "],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.47"],"ratings_count":["51023"],"description":["Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure.<br /><br />But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe.<br /><br />And then he sees the flying saucer.<br /><br />Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i>—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. <br /><br />No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it.<br /><br />It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can’t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little…familiar?<br /><br />At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could, <i>Armada</i> is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make <i>Ready Player One</i> a phenomenon."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["31712"],"name":["Ernest Cline"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310753539p5/31712.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310753539p2/31712.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31712.Ernest_Cline"],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["414136"],"text_reviews_count":["54940"]}]}],"published":["2015"]},{"id":[{"_":"77013","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["067973225X"],"isbn13":["9780679732259"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4368","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["As I Lay Dying"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451810782m/77013.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451810782s/77013.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77013.As_I_Lay_Dying"],"num_pages":["267"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Book Club Edition"],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.72"],"ratings_count":["105882"],"description":["<i>Alternate cover edition: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19075620-as-i-lay-dying\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></i><br /><br /><i>As I Lay Dying</i> is Faulkner's harrowing account of the Bundren family's odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury Addie, their wife and mother.

His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.<br /><br />Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.<br /><br />With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: <br /><blockquote> Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. </blockquote><br />Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, <i>Bel Canto</i> remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7136914"],"name":["Ann Patchett"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p5/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p2/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7136914.Ann_Patchett"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["482682"],"text_reviews_count":["45637"]}]}],"published":["2005"]},{"id":[{"_":"43892","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812551478"],"isbn13":["9780812551471"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"783","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth, #3)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443563626m/43892.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443563626s/43892.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43892.Blood_of_the_Fold"],"num_pages":["623"],"format":["Mass Market Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["1997"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["62430"],"description":["<i>There is an alternate cover edition <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32334208-blood-of-the-fold\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Richard comes to terms with his true identity as a War Wizard.

It's the living. One night, after a few drinks at an office party, Quirke shuffles down into the morgue where he works and finds his brother-in-law, Malachy, altering a file he has no business even reading. Odd enough in itself to find Malachy there, but the next morning, when the haze has lifted, it looks an awful lot like his brother-in-law, the esteemed doctor, was in fact tampering with a corpse--and concealing the cause of death.<br /><br />It turns out the body belonged to a young woman named Christine Falls. And as Quirke reluctantly presses on toward the true facts behind her death, he comes up against some insidious--and very well-guarded--secrets of Dublin's high Catholic society, among them members of his own family.<br /><br />Set in Dublin and Boston in the 1950s, the first novel in the Quirke series brings all the vividness and psychological insight of Booker Prize winner John Banville's fiction to a thrilling, atmospheric crime story. Quirke is a fascinating and subtly drawn hero, <i>Christine Falls</i> is a classic tale of suspense, and Benjamin Black's debut marks him as a true master of the form."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["116405"],"name":["Benjamin Black"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1370375172p5/116405.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1370375172p2/116405.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/116405.Benjamin_Black"],"average_rating":["3.49"],"ratings_count":["20286"],"text_reviews_count":["3163"]}]}],"published":["2006"]},{"id":[{"_":"40470","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0679747192"],"isbn13":["9780679747192"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"749","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Cities of the Plain (The Border Trilogy, #3)"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40470.Cities_of_the_Plain"],"num_pages":["292"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Vintage"],"publication_day":["25"],"publication_year":["1999"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["4.07"],"ratings_count":["14898"],"description":["The concluding volume of the Border trilogy.

They look harmless—mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the “steam” that children with the “shining” produce when they are slowly tortured to death.<br /><br />Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father’s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant “shining” power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes “Doctor Sleep.”<br /><br />Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan’s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra’s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of The Shining and satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3389"],"name":["Stephen King"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"],"average_rating":["4.00"],"ratings_count":["9713981"],"text_reviews_count":["319123"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"4406","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0142000655"],"isbn13":["9780142000656"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"12250","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["East of Eden"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441547516m/4406.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441547516s/4406.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden"],"num_pages":["601"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Centennial Edition"],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["4.34"],"ratings_count":["322114"],"description":["Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.<br /><br />Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.<br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.<br /><br />A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.

With stories culled from her own family history, Fabiano paints an entrancing portrait of Giovanna Costa, who, reeling from personal tragedies, tries to make a new life in a new world. Shot through with the smells and sights of Scilla, Italy, and New York’s burgeoning Little Italy, this intoxicating story follows Giovanna as she finds companionship, celebrates the birth of a baby girl, takes pride in a growing business, and feels a sense of belonging during a family outing to Coney Island.<br /><br /><br /><br />However, these modest successes are rewarded with the attention of the notorious Black Hand, a gang of brutal extortionists led by Lupo the Wolf.

With rich characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, <b>Golden Fool</b> brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.<br /><br /><b>Golden Fool<br /><br /></b>Prince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible. Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock, bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly, Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.<br /><br />The problems are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets. Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread “beast magic.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process, they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous consequences for all.<br /><br />Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with the Fool brings him any solace. But even that is shattered when unexpected visitors from Bingtown reveal devastating secrets from the Fool’s past. Now, bereft of support and adrift in intrigue, Fitz’s biggest challenge may be simply to survive the inescapable and violent path that fate has laid out for him.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["25307"],"name":["Robin Hobb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p5/25307.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p2/25307.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25307.Robin_Hobb"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["775551"],"text_reviews_count":["26838"]}]}],"published":["2003"]},{"id":[{"_":"2623","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0192833596"],"isbn13":["9780192833594"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8793","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Great Expectations"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327920219m/2623.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327920219s/2623.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2623.Great_Expectations"],"num_pages":["505"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Oxford World's Classics"],"publisher":["Oxford University Press"],"publication_day":["25"],"publication_year":["1998"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["479560"],"description":["In what may be Dickens's best novel, humble, orphaned Pip is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman — and one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of \"great expectations.\" In this gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, the compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["239579"],"name":["Charles Dickens"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1387078070p5/239579.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1387078070p2/239579.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/239579.Charles_Dickens"],"average_rating":["3.86"],"ratings_count":["2369208"],"text_reviews_count":["63227"]}]}],"published":["1998"]},{"id":[{"_":"28588073","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804141290"],"isbn13":["9780804141291"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"819","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Hag-Seed"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463887982m/28588073.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463887982s/28588073.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28588073-hag-seed"],"num_pages":["301"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Hogarth"],"publication_day":["11"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.95"],"ratings_count":["5078"],"description":["When Felix is deposed as artistic director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival by his devious assistant and longtime enemy, his production of The Tempest is canceled and he is heartbroken.

The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters -- including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations -- engages in incomparably rich dialogue.

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.<br /><br />Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.<br /><br />As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. Max Barry's most spellbinding and ambitious novel yet, <i>Lexicon</i> is a brilliant thriller that explores language, power, identity, and our capacity to love--whatever the cost."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["18741"],"name":["Max Barry"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p5/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p2/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18741.Max_Barry"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["47097"],"text_reviews_count":["5571"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"21418013","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0765375869"],"isbn13":["9780765375865"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3185","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Lock In (Lock In, #1)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438701397m/21418013.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438701397s/21418013.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21418013-lock-in"],"num_pages":["336"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Tor Books"],"publication_day":["26"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.84"],"ratings_count":["32063"],"description":["A blazingly inventive near-future thriller from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi.<br /><br />Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.<br /><br />A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.<br /><br />But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture.

Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America, but most of all, it is a meditation on love–love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.

The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br /><br />Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF.

And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.<br /><br />John Perry is taking that deal.

Now, the international bestselling and multiple award-winning author revisits that invented setting four centuries later with an epic of prideful emperors, battling courtiers, bandits and soldiers, nomadic invasions, and a woman battling in her own way, to find a new place for women in the world – a world inspired this time by the glittering, decadent Song Dynasty.<br /><br />Ren Daiyan was still just a boy when he took the lives of seven men while guarding an imperial magistrate of Kitai. That moment on a lonely road changed his life—in entirely unexpected ways, sending him into the forests of Kitai among the outlaws. From there he emerges years later—and his life changes again, dramatically, as he circles towards the court and emperor, while war approaches Kitai from the north.<br /><br />Lin Shan is the daughter of a scholar, his beloved only child. Educated by him in ways young women never are, gifted as a songwriter and calligrapher, she finds herself living a life suspended between two worlds. Her intelligence captivates an emperor—and alienates women at the court. But when her father’s life is endangered by the savage politics of the day, Shan must act in ways no woman ever has.<br /><br />In an empire divided by bitter factions circling an exquisitely cultured emperor who loves his gardens and his art far more than the burdens of governing, dramatic events on the northern steppe alter the balance of power in the world, leading to events no one could have foretold, under the river of stars."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["153402"],"text_reviews_count":["9155"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"429084","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0521825466"],"isbn13":["9780521825467"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Romeo and Juliet"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429084.Romeo_and_Juliet"],"num_pages":["266"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Cambridge University Press"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.73"],"ratings_count":["1598083"],"description":["Blakemore Evans' performance history helps readers visualize the stage action of Romeo and Juliet and alerts them to difficulties in language, thought and staging.

But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Piedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries - memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from <i>Star Trek</i>: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.<br /><br />Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all.

Once a simple woods guide, Richard was forced to become the Seeker of Truth, to save the world from the vile dominance of Darken Rahl, the most viciously savage and powerful wizard the world had ever seen. He was joined on this epic quest by his beloved Kahlan, the only survivor among the Confessors, who brought a powerful but benevolent justice to the land before Rahl's evil scourge. Aided by Zedd, the last of the wizards who opposed Rahl, they were able to cast him into the underworld, saving the world from the living hell of life under Rahl.<br /><br />But the veil to the underworld has been torn, and Rahl, from beyond the veil, begins to summon a sinister power more dreadful than any he has wielded before.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.99"],"ratings_count":["144"],"text_reviews_count":["29"]}]}],"published":["2009"]},{"id":[{"_":"431274","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0439895294"],"isbn13":["9780439895293"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"269","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Arrival"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075m/431274.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075s/431274.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431274.The_Arrival"],"num_pages":["124"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Arthur A.

Jim, a sleek, successful corporate lawyer, has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives, and Bob, a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim, has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister, Susan—the Burgess sibling who stayed behind—urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son, Zach, has gotten himself into a world of trouble, and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood, where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever.<br /><br />With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling, exquisite prose, and remarkable insight into character, Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page.

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951.

First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought onto the plain by settlers - this when all the wisdom of trappers has disappeared along with the trappers themselves.

However, it is his destiny to travel to the dwarflands in the east, to help slay the dragon Smaug. His quest takes him through enchanted forests, spiders' lairs, and under the Misty Mountains, where he comes across the vile Gollum, and tricks him out of his 'Precious' - a ring that makes its bearer invisible, and wields a terrible power of its own.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition:<br /><br />\"If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) - if you do not already know all about these things - much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period.\"<br /><br />\"For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

The lives of men and women are as challenging as the climate and lands in which they dwell. For generations, the Erlings of Vinmark have taken their dragon-prowed ships across the seas, raiding the lands of the Cyngael and Anglcyn peoples, leaving fire and death behind.

Set in a fantastic city pulsing with the lives of decadent nobles and daring thieves, here is a story of adventure, loyalty, and survival that is one part \"Robin Hood\", one part Ocean's Eleven, and entirely enthralling... <br /><br />An orphan's life is harsh — and often short — in the island city of Camorr, built on the ruins of a mysterious alien race. But born with a quick wit and a gift for thieving, Locke Lamora has dodged both death and slavery, only to fall into the hands of an eyeless priest known as Chains — a man who is neither blind nor a priest.<br /><br />A con artist of extraordinary talent, Chains passes his skills on to his carefully selected \"family\" of orphans — a group known as the Gentlemen Bastards. Under his tutelage, Locke grows to lead the Bastards, delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another. Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr, and no wealthy noble is safe from his sting.<br /><br />Passing themselves off as petty thieves, the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of light-fingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworld's most feared ruler, Capa Barsavi. But there is someone in the shadows more powerful — and more ambitious — than Locke has yet imagined. <br /><br />Known as the Gray King, he is slowly killing Capa Barsavi's most trusted men — and using Locke as a pawn in his plot to take control of Camorr's underworld. With a bloody coup under way threatening to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the Gray King at his own brutal game — or die trying...<br /><br />"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["73149"],"name":["Scott Lynch"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332432746p5/73149.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332432746p2/73149.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73149.Scott_Lynch"],"average_rating":["4.24"],"ratings_count":["260061"],"text_reviews_count":["17559"]}]}],"published":["2006"]},{"id":[{"_":"100915","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0060764899"],"isbn13":["9780060764890"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"10875","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353029077m/100915.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353029077s/100915.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.The_Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe"],"num_pages":["206"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["HarperCollins Publishers"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["1484238"],"description":["'They say Aslan is on the move.

In American colleges, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. <br /><br />As Madeleine studies the age-old motivations of the human heart, real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead - charismatic loner and college Darwinist - suddenly turns up in a seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old friend Mitchell Grammaticus - who’s been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange - resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.<br /><br />Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they have learned. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology laboratory on Cape Cod, but can’t escape the secret responsible for Leonard’s seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.<br /><br />Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce?

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["3937346"],"text_reviews_count":["221855"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"386299","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"849","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Old Man and the Sea"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413853675m/386299.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413853675s/386299.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386299.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea"],"num_pages":["128"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Scribner"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["1995"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.71"],"ratings_count":["529854"],"description":["It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream.

There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.<br /><br />Considering himself “a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,” Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive.

Douglas. One of the best-selling titles of the '40s, it entered the NY Times Best Seller list in 10/42 &amp; a month later rose to #1, holding the position nearly a year. It remained on the list another two years, returning other times over the next several years including when the film was released in '53. Douglas began writing upon leaving the ministry at 52. All his novels, essays &amp; short stories relied on his religious background for inspiration. At the height of popularity, he was receiving about 100 fan letters weekly. One of these letters provided this novel's inspiration. Hazel McCann, an Ohio department store clerk, wrote asking what he thought had happened to Jesus' garments. He immediately began working on a novel based on this concept, sending each chapter to McCann as he finished it. They met in '41. He dedicated the book to her.<br /> The book explores the aftermath of the crucifixion thru the experiences of Marcellus Gallio, the Roman tribune who commanded the unit in charge. Prince Gaius sends Marcellus to take command of the garrison at Minoa, a port city in S. Palestine. Marcellus is accompanied by his slave Demetrius. Marcellus &amp; other soldiers throw dice to see who'll take Jesus' Robe. Marcellus wins &amp; asks Demetrius to take care of the Robe. Following the crucifixion, Marcellus takes part in a banquet attended by Pontius Pilate. During the banquet, a drunken centurion insists that Marcellus wear the robe. Marcellus goes on a journey, following the path Jesus took &amp; meets people whose lives he'd affected.

The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, carving a place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men-complicating his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized or fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belong-a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny. <br /><br />Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and JA, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.<br /><br />Phillipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, children are sacrificed in the name of ambition, as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCoulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices.<br /><br />Harrowing, panoramic, and vividly drawn, The Son is a masterful achievement from a sublime young talent."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["794012"],"name":["Philipp Meyer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p5/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p2/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/794012.Philipp_Meyer"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["28644"],"text_reviews_count":["3844"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"18293427","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1616203218"],"isbn13":["9781616206314"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"15666","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Storied Life of A.J.

J. Fikry, the irascible owner, is about to discover just what that truly means.<br /><br />A. J. Fikry’s life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who’s always felt kindly toward Fikry; from Ismay, his sister-in-law who is hell-bent on saving him from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who keeps on taking the ferry over to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.’s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It’s a small package, but large in weight. It’s that unexpected arrival that gives A. J. Fikry the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn’t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J.; or for that determined sales rep, Amelia, to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light; or for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.’s world; or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn’t see coming.

A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates.

Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.<br /><br />All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents.

Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In \"Adventure Story\"--a thematic companion to <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent.

Dangerous, mythic figures from the Celtic and Roman conflicts of the past erupt into the present, claiming and changing lives.<br /><br />The protagonist is Ned Marriner, the fifteen year-old son of a well-known photographer.
