While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke... Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3389"],"name":["Stephen King"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"],"average_rating":["4.01"],"ratings_count":["10508542"],"text_reviews_count":["358265"]}]}],"published":["2011"],"work":[{"id":["15553789"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"10572","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0553381695"],"isbn13":["9780553381696"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"14972","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)"],"title_without_series":["A Clash of Kings"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974m/10572.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974s/10572.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10572.A_Clash_of_Kings"],"num_pages":["761"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Bantam"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["614757"],"description":["Alternate cover edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6041689-a-clash-of-kings\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. <br /><br /><br />Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br /><br />As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. <br /><br />A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. <br /><br />Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. <br /><br />Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment;a tale of pure excitement you will never forget."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["346732"],"name":["George R.R.

Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.<br /><br />Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall. Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords..."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["346732"],"name":["George R.R.

One night, after a few drinks at an office party, Quirke shuffles down into the morgue where he works and finds his brother-in-law, Malachy, altering a file he has no business even reading. Odd enough in itself to find Malachy there, but the next morning, when the haze has lifted, it looks an awful lot like his brother-in-law, the esteemed doctor, was in fact tampering with a corpse—and concealing the cause of death. <br /><br />It turns out the body belonged to a young woman named Christine Falls.

They look harmless—mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the “steam” that children with the “shining” produce when they are slowly tortured to death.<br /><br />Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father’s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant “shining” power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes “Doctor Sleep.”<br /><br />Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan’s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra’s soul and survival.

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.<br /><br />Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.<br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.<br /><br />A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.

In \"Hurricanes Anonymous\" - first included in the Best American Short Stories anthology - a young man searches for the mother of his son in a Louisiana devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. And in the unforgettable title story, Johnson returns to his signature subject, North Korea, depicting two defectors from Pyongyang who are trying to adapt to their new lives in Seoul, while one cannot forget the woman he left behind. <br /><br />Unnerving, riveting, and written with a timeless quality, these stories confirm Johnson as one of America's greatest writers and an indispensable guide to our new century."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["36615"],"name":["Adam Johnson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p5/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p2/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36615.Adam_Johnson"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["74968"],"text_reviews_count":["9985"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["43193279"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"45109","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0553582453"],"isbn13":["9780553582451"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"650","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Golden Fool (Tawny Man, #2)"],"title_without_series":["Golden Fool"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45109.Golden_Fool"],"num_pages":["709"],"format":["Mass Market Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Spectra"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["12"],"average_rating":["4.32"],"ratings_count":["49105"],"description":["The acclaimed <i>Farseer</i> and <i>Liveship Traders</i> trilogies established Robin Hobb as one of the most splendidly imaginative practitioners of world-class fantasy. <br /><br />Now, in Book 2 of her most stunning trilogy yet, Hobb continues the soul-shattering tale of FitzChivalry Farseer. With rich characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, <b>Golden Fool</b> brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.<br /><br /><b>Golden Fool<br /><br /></b>Prince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible. Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock, bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly, Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.<br /><br />The problems are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets. Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread “beast magic.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process, they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous consequences for all.<br /><br />Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with the Fool brings him any solace. But even that is shattered when unexpected visitors from Bingtown reveal devastating secrets from the Fool’s past. Now, bereft of support and adrift in intrigue, Fitz’s biggest challenge may be simply to survive the inescapable and violent path that fate has laid out for him.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["25307"],"name":["Robin Hobb"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p5/25307.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397885202p2/25307.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25307.Robin_Hobb"],"average_rating":["4.17"],"ratings_count":["867766"],"text_reviews_count":["32048"]}]}],"published":["2003"],"work":[{"id":["2960727"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"2623","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0192833596"],"isbn13":["9780192833594"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9253","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Great Expectations"],"title_without_series":["Great Expectations"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327920219m/2623.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327920219s/2623.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2623.Great_Expectations"],"num_pages":["505"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Oxford World's Classics"],"publisher":["Oxford University Press"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["1998"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.75"],"ratings_count":["512579"],"description":["In what may be Dickens's best novel, humble, orphaned Pip is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman — and one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of \"great expectations.\" In this gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, the compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["239579"],"name":["Charles Dickens"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1387078070p5/239579.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1387078070p2/239579.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/239579.Charles_Dickens"],"average_rating":["3.87"],"ratings_count":["2510343"],"text_reviews_count":["67490"]}]}],"published":["1998"],"work":[{"id":["2612809"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"28588073","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804141290"],"isbn13":["9780804141291"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1538","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Hag-Seed"],"title_without_series":["Hag-Seed"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463887982m/28588073.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463887982s/28588073.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28588073-hag-seed"],"num_pages":["301"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["10980"],"description":["When Felix is deposed as artistic director of the Makeshiweg Theatre Festival by his devious assistant and longtime enemy, his production of The Tempest is canceled and he is heartbroken.

But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers. There are those among the Forsaken who will go to any length to see him dead--and the Black Ajah is at his side.... Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him. For reasons of her own, which she will not reveal until a time of her choosing, she has pledged not to escape, but Mat still sweats whenever there are Seanchan soldiers near. Then he learns that Tuon herself is in deadly danger from those very soldiers. To get her to safety, he must do what he hates worse than work.... In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown.... In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within.... The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["6252"],"name":["Robert Jordan"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1175475715p5/6252.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1175475715p2/6252.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6252.Robert_Jordan"],"average_rating":["4.16"],"ratings_count":["1790352"],"text_reviews_count":["40459"]}]}],"published":["2006"],"work":[{"id":["987750"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"8855321","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1841499889"],"isbn13":["9781841499888"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"5727","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Leviathan Wakes"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411013134m/8855321.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411013134s/8855321.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes"],"num_pages":["561"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Orbit"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.20"],"ratings_count":["85668"],"description":["Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.<br /><br />Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt.

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.<br /><br />Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.<br /><br />As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, <i>Lexicon</i> is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["18741"],"name":["Max Barry"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p5/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p2/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18741.Max_Barry"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["49964"],"text_reviews_count":["5860"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["20077336"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"21418013","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0765375869"],"isbn13":["9780765375865"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3498","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Lock In (Lock In, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Lock In"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438701397m/21418013.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438701397s/21418013.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21418013-lock-in"],"num_pages":["336"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Tor Books"],"publication_day":["26"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["35846"],"description":["A blazingly inventive near-future thriller from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi.<br /><br />Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.<br /><br />A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.<br /><br />But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture.

But the setting of Resurrection is the underworld, and Tolstoy turns a highly critical eye on the law, the penal system and, above all, the Church.<br /><br />With its theme of fallen man and an emphatic regeneration, the novel presents a mature panorama of human life, shot through with searing spiritual intensity."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["128382"],"name":["Leo Tolstoy"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506091388p5/128382.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506091388p2/128382.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/128382.Leo_Tolstoy"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["863078"],"text_reviews_count":["38595"]}]}],"published":["1966"],"work":[{"id":["1491227"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"6732019","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0307463745"],"isbn13":["9780307463746"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2720","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Rework"],"title_without_series":["Rework"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6732019-rework"],"num_pages":["279"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown Business"],"publication_day":["9"],"publication_year":["2010"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["3.93"],"ratings_count":["94513"],"description":["Most business books give you the same old advice: Write a business plan, study the competition, seek investors, yadda yadda.

Now, the international bestselling and multiple award-winning author revisits that invented setting four centuries later with an epic of prideful emperors, battling courtiers, bandits and soldiers, nomadic invasions, and a woman battling in her own way, to find a new place for women in the world – a world inspired this time by the glittering, decadent Song Dynasty.<br /><br />Ren Daiyan was still just a boy when he took the lives of seven men while guarding an imperial magistrate of Kitai. That moment on a lonely road changed his life—in entirely unexpected ways, sending him into the forests of Kitai among the outlaws. From there he emerges years later—and his life changes again, dramatically, as he circles towards the court and emperor, while war approaches Kitai from the north.<br /><br />Lin Shan is the daughter of a scholar, his beloved only child. Educated by him in ways young women never are, gifted as a songwriter and calligrapher, she finds herself living a life suspended between two worlds. Her intelligence captivates an emperor—and alienates women at the court. But when her father’s life is endangered by the savage politics of the day, Shan must act in ways no woman ever has.<br /><br />In an empire divided by bitter factions circling an exquisitely cultured emperor who loves his gardens and his art far more than the burdens of governing, dramatic events on the northern steppe alter the balance of power in the world, leading to events no one could have foretold, under the river of stars."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["163847"],"text_reviews_count":["9864"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["21451403"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"429084","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0521825466"],"isbn13":["9780521825467"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Romeo and Juliet"],"title_without_series":["Romeo and Juliet"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429084.Romeo_and_Juliet"],"num_pages":["266"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Cambridge University Press"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["1688080"],"description":["Blakemore Evans' performance history helps readers visualize the stage action of Romeo and Juliet and alerts them to difficulties in language, thought and staging.

Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer's curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. <br /><br />No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka's motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka's youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka's frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration. But not until the snows have melted and the political violence has run its bloody course will Ka discover the fate of his bid to seize a last chance for happiness. <br /><br />Blending profound sympathy and mischievous wit, Snow illuminates the contradictions gripping the individual and collective heart in many parts of the Muslim world.

But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries--memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.94"],"ratings_count":["159"],"text_reviews_count":["31"]}]}],"published":["2009"],"work":[{"id":["7075790"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"431274","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0439895294"],"isbn13":["9780439895293"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"288","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Arrival"],"title_without_series":["The Arrival"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075m/431274.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075s/431274.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431274.The_Arrival"],"num_pages":["124"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Arthur A.

Jim, a sleek, successful corporate lawyer, has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives, and Bob, a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim, has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister, Susan—the Burgess sibling who stayed behind—urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son, Zach, has gotten himself into a world of trouble, and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood, where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever.<br /><br />With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling, exquisite prose, and remarkable insight into character, Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page. Tender, tough-minded, loving, and deeply illuminating about the ties that bind us to family and home, <i>The Burgess Boys</i> is Elizabeth Strout’s newest and perhaps most astonishing work of literary art."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["97313"],"name":["Elizabeth Strout"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1361387789p5/97313.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1361387789p2/97313.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/97313.Elizabeth_Strout"],"average_rating":["3.67"],"ratings_count":["260384"],"text_reviews_count":["33678"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["21553934"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"5107","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316769177"],"isbn13":["9780316769174"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"37748","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Catcher in the Rye"],"title_without_series":["The Catcher in the Rye"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398034300m/5107.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398034300s/5107.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye"],"num_pages":["277"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Back Bay Books"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2001"],"publication_month":["1"],"average_rating":["3.79"],"ratings_count":["2143793"],"description":["The hero-narrator of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on <i>Time</i>'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["819789"],"name":["J.D.

In the bootheel of New Mexico hard on the frontier, Billy and Boyd Parham are just boys in the years before the Second World War, but on the cusp of unimaginable events. First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought onto the plain by settlers - this when all the wisdom of trappers has disappeared along with the trappers themselves. So Billy sets forth at the age of sixteen on an unwitting journey into the souls of boys, animals and men.<br /><br />Having trapped a she-wolf he would restore to the mountains of Mexico, he is long gone and returns to find everything he left behind transformed utterly in his absence.

And mankind is not ready.<br /><br />The final volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light, was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor---his wife, Harriet McDougal---to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents The Gathering Storm as the first of three novels that will make up A Memory of Light. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.<br /><br />In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward---wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders---his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.<br /><br />Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower---and possibly the world itself.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass.

It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["8719"],"name":["Donna Tartt"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1409871301p5/8719.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1409871301p2/8719.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8719.Donna_Tartt"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["704462"],"text_reviews_count":["62835"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["24065147"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"18952341","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1481424270"],"isbn13":["9781481424271"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"978","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Grace of Kings (The Dandelion Dynasty, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Grace of Kings"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403024981m/18952341.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403024981s/18952341.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings"],"num_pages":["623"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Simon & Schuster"],"publication_day":["7"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.75"],"ratings_count":["7010"],"description":["Two men rebel together against tyranny—and then become rivals—in this first sweeping book of an epic fantasy series from Ken Liu, recipient of Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards.<br /><br />Wily, charming Kuni Garu, a bandit, and stern, fearless Mata Zyndu, the son of a deposed duke, seem like polar opposites.

However, it is his destiny to travel to the dwarflands in the east, to help slay the dragon Smaug. His quest takes him through enchanted forests, spiders' lairs, and under the Misty Mountains, where he comes across the vile Gollum, and tricks him out of his 'Precious' - a ring that makes its bearer invisible, and wields a terrible power of its own.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition:<br /><br />\"If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) - if you do not already know all about these things - much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period.\"<br /><br />\"For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

This brooding mansion is haunted by a centuries-old curse that casts the shadow of ancestral sin upon the last four members of the distinctive Pyncheon family of Salem. The greed and haughty pride of the Pyncheon family through the generations is mirrored in the gloomy decay of their seven-gabled mansion, where the family's enfeebled and impoverished relations now live. Mysterious deaths threaten the living. Musty documents nestle behind hidden panels carrying the secret of the family's salvation--or its downfall.

For generations, the Erlings of Vinmark have taken their dragon-prowed ships across the seas, raiding the lands of the Cyngael and Anglcyn peoples, leaving fire and death behind.

Set in a fantastic city pulsing with the lives of decadent nobles and daring thieves, here is a story of adventure, loyalty, and survival that is one part \"Robin Hood\", one part Ocean's Eleven, and entirely enthralling... <br /><br />An orphan's life is harsh — and often short — in the island city of Camorr, built on the ruins of a mysterious alien race. But born with a quick wit and a gift for thieving, Locke Lamora has dodged both death and slavery, only to fall into the hands of an eyeless priest known as Chains — a man who is neither blind nor a priest.<br /><br />A con artist of extraordinary talent, Chains passes his skills on to his carefully selected \"family\" of orphans — a group known as the Gentlemen Bastards. Under his tutelage, Locke grows to lead the Bastards, delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another. Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr, and no wealthy noble is safe from his sting.<br /><br />Passing themselves off as petty thieves, the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of light-fingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworld's most feared ruler, Capa Barsavi. But there is someone in the shadows more powerful — and more ambitious — than Locke has yet imagined. <br /><br />Known as the Gray King, he is slowly killing Capa Barsavi's most trusted men — and using Locke as a pawn in his plot to take control of Camorr's underworld. With a bloody coup under way threatening to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the Gray King at his own brutal game — or die trying...<br /><br />"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["73149"],"name":["Scott Lynch"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332432746p5/73149.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332432746p2/73149.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73149.Scott_Lynch"],"average_rating":["4.25"],"ratings_count":["293701"],"text_reviews_count":["19527"]}]}],"published":["2006"],"work":[{"id":["2116675"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"100915","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0060764899"],"isbn13":["9780060764890"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11736","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353029077m/100915.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353029077s/100915.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.The_Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe"],"num_pages":["206"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Film Tie-in Edition"],"publisher":["HarperCollins Publishers"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.19"],"ratings_count":["1607918"],"description":["<i>They open a door and enter a world</i> <br /><br />NARNIA...the land beyond the wardrobe, the secret country known only to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy...the place where the adventure begins.<br /><br />Lucy is the first to find the secret of the wardrobe in the professor's mysterious old house.

A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. <br /><br />He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. <br /><br />At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren’t black and white, love and sex aren’t simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["142270"],"name":["Lev Grossman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1386343699p5/142270.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1386343699p2/142270.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/142270.Lev_Grossman"],"average_rating":["3.67"],"ratings_count":["308426"],"text_reviews_count":["33179"]}]}],"published":["2009"],"work":[{"id":["6278977"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"10964693","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0374203059"],"isbn13":["9780374203054"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9571","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Marriage Plot"],"title_without_series":["The Marriage Plot"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328736940m/10964693.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328736940s/10964693.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot"],"num_pages":["406"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["First Edition"],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.43"],"ratings_count":["99881"],"description":["With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.<br /><br />It's the early 1980s - the country is in a deep recession, and life after college is harder than ever. In the cafés on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to the Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. <br /><br />As Madeleine tries to understand why \"it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth century France,\" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead - charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy - suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old \"friend\" Mitchell Grammaticus - who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange - resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate. <br /><br />Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love. <br /><br />Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1467"],"name":["Jeffrey Eugenides"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1374107943p5/1467.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1374107943p2/1467.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1467.Jeffrey_Eugenides"],"average_rating":["3.95"],"ratings_count":["1396914"],"text_reviews_count":["53203"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["15668403"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"18007564","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804139024"],"isbn13":["9780804139021"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"49597","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Martian"],"title_without_series":["The Martian"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054m/18007564.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054s/18007564.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian"],"num_pages":["369"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown"],"publication_day":["11"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["4.39"],"ratings_count":["537742"],"description":["Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. <br /><br />Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.<br /><br />After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive — and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. <br /><br />Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death.

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4355267"],"text_reviews_count":["252153"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["21500681"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"386299","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"883","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Old Man and the Sea"],"title_without_series":["The Old Man and the Sea"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413853675m/386299.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413853675s/386299.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386299.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea"],"num_pages":["128"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Scribner"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["1995"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.73"],"ratings_count":["583306"],"description":["It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream.

There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.<br /><br />Considering himself \"a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,\" Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive.

The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, carving a place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men-complicating his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized or fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belong-a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny. <br /><br />Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and JA, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.<br /><br />Phillipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, children are sacrificed in the name of ambition, as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCoulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices.<br /><br />Harrowing, panoramic, and vividly drawn, The Son is a masterful achievement from a sublime young talent."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["794012"],"name":["Philipp Meyer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p5/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p2/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/794012.Philipp_Meyer"],"average_rating":["3.92"],"ratings_count":["32323"],"text_reviews_count":["4197"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["19110442"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"18293427","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1616203218"],"isbn13":["9781616203214"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"17254","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Storied Life of A.J.

Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.<br /><br />We are not quite novels.<br /><br />We are not quite short stories.<br /><br />In the end, we are collected works.<br /><br />A. J. Fikry's life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died; his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history; and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Chief Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who's always felt kindly toward him; from Ismay, his sister-in-law, who is hell-bent on saving A.J. from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who persists in taking the ferry to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.'s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, he can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It's a small package, though large in weight—an unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn't take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J., for the determined sales rep Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light, for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.'s world.

Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In \"Adventure Story\"--a thematic companion to <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, <i>Trigger Warning</i> is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4355267"],"text_reviews_count":["252153"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["41947380"]}]},{"id":[{"_":"4556604","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0758228775"],"isbn13":["9780758228772"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"377","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Two Rivers"],"title_without_series":["Two Rivers"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4556604-two-rivers"],"num_pages":["367"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Kensington Books"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2009"],"publication_month":["1"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["2513"],"description":["In Two Rivers, Vermont, Harper Montgomery is living a life overshadowed by grief and guilt.

It was not until 1862, the year of Thoreau's death, that the book was brought back into print, and it has never been out of print since.
