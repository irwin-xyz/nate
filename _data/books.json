Can our world support that? What kind of world will it be? Those answering these questions generally fall into two deeply divided groups--Wizards and Prophets, as Charles Mann calls them in this balanced, authoritative, nonpolemical new book. The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. <i>Cut back</i>! was his mantra. <i>Otherwise everyone will lose</i>! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. <i>Innovate</i>! was Borlaug's cry. <i>Only in that way can everyone win</i>! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <em>Norse Mythology</em>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B01HQA6EOC <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39673345-norse-mythology\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4810155"],"text_reviews_count":["282051"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["51396954"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZjetaSgZLpRuwbsCvexmjg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1949850409","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"date_updated":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2277996853"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"34146863","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1943888108"],"isbn13":["9781943888108"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5Iu0dxorgFKOSw0F37NV_A"],"title":["Mammother"],"title_without_series":["Mammother"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165m/34146863.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165s/34146863.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34146863-mammother"],"num_pages":["328"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Featherproof Books"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2017"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["50"],"description":["The people of Pie Time are suffering from God's Finger, a mysterious plague that leaves its victims dead with a big hole through their chests.

At the heart of the story are Sam Finster, a senior in high school mourning the death of his mother, and his sister Trina, a nine-year-old deaf girl who denies her grief by dreaming of a nuclear apocalypse as Cold War tensions rise.

Huck, abandoned and “dreadful lonely,” hires himself out to “whosoever.” He rides shotgun on coaches, wrangles horses on a Chisholm Trail cattle drive, joins a gang of bandits, guides wagon trains, gets dragged into U.S. Army massacres, and suffers a series of romantic and barroom misadventures.<br /><br />He is eventually drawn into a Lakota tribe by a young brave, Eeteh, an inventive teller of Coyote tales who “was having about the same kind of trouble with his tribe as I was having with mine.” There is an army colonel who wants to hang Huck and destroy Eeteh’s tribe, so they’re both on the run, finding themselves ultimately in the Black Hills just ahead of the 1876 Gold Rush.<br /><br />This period, from the middle of the Civil War to the centennial year of 1876, is probably the most formative era of the nation’s history. In the West, it is a time of grand adventure, but also one of greed, religious insanity, mass slaughter, virulent hatreds, widespread poverty and ignorance, ruthless military and civilian leadership, huge disparities of wealth. Only Huck’s sympathetic and gently comical voice can make it somehow bearable."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["16086"],"name":["Robert Coover"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1453232246p5/16086.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1453232246p2/16086.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16086.Robert_Coover"],"average_rating":["3.78"],"ratings_count":["11500"],"text_reviews_count":["1506"]}]}],"published":["2017"],"work":[{"id":["50692587"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.EjZf08J7d80k19wCVfs8mQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1924843128","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Jan 30 09:02:48 -0800 2018"],"date_updated":["Tue Jan 30 09:02:49 -0800 2018"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2277994824"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2277994824"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2277993612"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"31213490","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1944211306"],"isbn13":["9781944211301"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"245","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lDbLfAiN3Ld9UgWE8NzNTw"],"title":["Sorry to Disrupt the Peace"],"title_without_series":["Sorry to Disrupt the Peace"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476987443m/31213490.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476987443s/31213490.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31213490-sorry-to-disrupt-the-peace"],"num_pages":["263"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["McSweeney's"],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2017"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["3.43"],"ratings_count":["1477"],"description":["Helen Moran is thirty-two years old, single, childless, college-educated, and partially employed as a guardian of troubled young people in New York.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student \"possessed,\" as he wrote, \"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. <br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. <br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\" he wrote. \"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["14031444"],"name":["Paul Kalanithi"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p5/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p2/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14031444.Paul_Kalanithi"],"average_rating":["4.33"],"ratings_count":["240784"],"text_reviews_count":["21833"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45424659"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oip55amienPK71A-wDcRGg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1715512408","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:23 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:24 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2010516934"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"28094574","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"512","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kGP1I1c7HpCBdduAyT6bXA"],"title":["It"],"title_without_series":["It"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28094574-it"],"num_pages":["1169"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["586399"],"description":["Welcome to Derry, Maine.

Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.<br /><br />At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.<br /><br />Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.<br /><br />Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.<br /><br />Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["33919"],"name":["Jeff VanderMeer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p5/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p2/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33919.Jeff_VanderMeer"],"average_rating":["3.68"],"ratings_count":["222079"],"text_reviews_count":["27111"]}]}],"published":["2017"],"work":[{"id":["48253660"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.plCUzpp1YC5oeLO-juikmg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1665142399","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1971644292"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"12591698","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1841499900"],"isbn13":["9781841499901"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3138","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.0XisucKtvM8-4g28MVMe8A"],"title":["Caliban's War (The Expanse, #2)"],"title_without_series":["Caliban's War"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377m/12591698.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377s/12591698.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12591698-caliban-s-war"],"num_pages":["595"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Orbit (Hachette)"],"publication_day":["26"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.30"],"ratings_count":["61969"],"description":["We are not alone.<br /><br />On Ganymede, breadbasket of the outer planets, a Martian marine watches as her platoon is slaughtered by a monstrous supersoldier.

Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3472"],"name":["Margaret Atwood"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1282859073p5/3472.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1282859073p2/3472.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3472.Margaret_Atwood"],"average_rating":["3.99"],"ratings_count":["1753628"],"text_reviews_count":["113219"]}]}],"published":["2004"],"work":[{"id":["3143431"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mfHxtIMqF6hFRWda8hXMFQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1625233844","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Apr 12 19:37:01 -0700 2017"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Apr 12 19:37:01 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Wed Apr 12 19:37:01 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1969994092"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1969994092"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1961211129"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"29363501","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1338109065"],"isbn13":["9781338109061"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2965","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5UeAtCJeKBbCngvbzRr-9g"],"title":["Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay"],"title_without_series":["Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481542648m/29363501.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481542648s/29363501.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29363501-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them"],"num_pages":["293"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Arthur A.

Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.<br /><br />Spanning five decades, <em>Commonwealth</em> explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the strange and genuine affection that grows up between them.<br /><br />When, in her twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book, ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt, and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another.<br /><br />Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, <em>Commonwealth</em> is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories.

But times change, even in the north, and in a tale woven with consummate artistry, people of all three cultures find the threads of their lives unexpectedly brought together...<br /><br />Bern Thorkellson, punished for his father's sins, commits an act of vengeance and desperation that brings him face-to-face, across the sea, with a past he's been trying to leave behind.<br /><br />In the Anglcyn lands of King Aeldred, the shrewd king, battling inner demons all the while, shores up his defenses with alliances and diplomacy-and with swords and arrows-while his exceptional, unpredictable sons and daughters pursue their own desires when battle comes and darkness falls in the woods.<br /><br />And in the valleys and shrouded hills of the Cyngael, whose voices carry music even as they feud and raid amongst each other, violence and love become deeply interwoven when the dragon ships come and Alun ab Owyn, chasing an enemy in the night, glimpses strange lights gleaming above forest pools.<br /><br />Making brilliant use of saga, song and chronicle, Kay brings to life an unforgettable world balanced on the knife-edge of change in The Last Light of the Sun."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["174090"],"text_reviews_count":["10529"]}]}],"published":["2005"],"work":[{"id":["416279"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.iaTBDPsh_wzwOm5j9ZG0SQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jan 02 08:42:43 -0800 2017"],"date_updated":["Mon Jan 02 08:42:47 -0800 2017"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1861687984"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1861687984"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1861687106"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"104085","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0451458974"],"isbn13":["9780451458971"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"384","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.C-1KEa4SN9-FY4t_y4Fotw"],"title":["A Song for Arbonne"],"title_without_series":["A Song for Arbonne"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309212350m/104085.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309212350s/104085.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104085.A_Song_for_Arbonne"],"num_pages":["509"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Ace Books"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["11"],"average_rating":["4.20"],"ratings_count":["11278"],"description":["Based on the troubadour culture that rose in Provence during the High Middle Ages, this panoramic, absorbing novel beautifully creates an alternate version of the medieval world.<br /><br />The matriarchal, cultured land of Arbonne is rent by a feud between its two most powerful dukes, the noble troubador Bertran de Talair and Urte de Miraval, over long-dead Aelis, lover of one, wife of the other and once heir to the country's throne.<br /><br />To the north lies militaristic Gorhaut, whose inhabitants worship the militant god Corannos and are ruled by corrupt, womanizing King Ademar.

But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children. He is gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.<br /><br />Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a 12-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox (his partner and closest friend) find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["138825"],"name":["Tana French"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1277505771p5/138825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1277505771p2/138825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/138825.Tana_French"],"average_rating":["3.88"],"ratings_count":["533469"],"text_reviews_count":["47091"]}]}],"published":["2007"],"work":[{"id":["3088141"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mPahoZvTd4vsoTHGWrhL0g"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1504037959","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Dec 18 11:03:49 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Dec 18 11:03:50 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842919524"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842919524"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1842918454"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"31549906","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["039360988X"],"isbn13":["9780393609882"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1113","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.DC-cheFdu1mMeKUS0EZSYA"],"title":["Do Not Say We Have Nothing"],"title_without_series":["Do Not Say We Have Nothing"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473220440m/31549906.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473220440s/31549906.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31549906-do-not-say-we-have-nothing"],"num_pages":["480"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["W.

The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life. I was ten years old.”<br /><br />Master storyteller Madeleine Thien takes us inside an extended family in China, showing us the lives of two successive generations—those who lived through Mao’s Cultural Revolution and their children, who became the students protesting in Tiananmen Square. At the center of this epic story are two young women, Marie and Ai-Ming. Through their relationship Marie strives to piece together the tale of her fractured family in present-day Vancouver, seeking answers in the fragile layers of their collective story. Her quest will unveil how Kai, her enigmatic father, a talented pianist, and Ai-Ming’s father, the shy and brilliant composer, Sparrow, along with the violin prodigy Zhuli were forced to reimagine their artistic and private selves during China’s political campaigns and how their fates reverberate through the years with lasting consequences.<br /><br />With maturity and sophistication, humor and beauty, Thien has crafted a novel that is at once intimate and grandly political, rooted in the details of life inside China yet transcendent in its universality."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["265535"],"name":["Madeleine Thien"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p5/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p2/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/265535.Madeleine_Thien"],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["13394"],"text_reviews_count":["2168"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["47869112"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1OOYQ0w6YUe93bciWWw9aQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1504037013","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:39 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:40 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1839709882"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"11566","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0451933028"],"isbn13":["9780451933027"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3817","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.sUre5ipqFqF26Shanfil-A"],"title":["The Green Mile"],"title_without_series":["The Green Mile"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563m/11566.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563s/11566.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11566.The_Green_Mile"],"num_pages":["592"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Six Volume Box Set "],"publisher":["Penguin Signet"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["1996"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.43"],"ratings_count":["206385"],"description":["When it first appeared, one volume per month, Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE was an unprecedented publishing triumph: all six volumes ended up on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller lists—simultaneously—and delighted millions of fans the world over.<br /><br />Welcome to Cold Mountain Penitentiary, home to the Depression-worn men of E Block.

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.<br /><br />Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.<br /><br />As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, <i>Lexicon</i> is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["18741"],"name":["Max Barry"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p5/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p2/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18741.Max_Barry"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["52704"],"text_reviews_count":["6071"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["20077336"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U1mmjxA6FhnAztz2O0MmQQ"]}]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:53 -0800 2016"],"read_at":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:13 -0800 2016"],"date_added":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:52 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:14 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1817580706"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23590496","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0857522973"],"isbn13":["9780857522979"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"804","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4OHq6Ghbd-Nq84nG8un-tQ"],"title":["Fortune Smiles"],"title_without_series":["Fortune Smiles"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824m/23590496.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824s/23590496.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23590496-fortune-smiles"],"num_pages":["304"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Doubleday"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["7732"],"description":["Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his acclaimed and bestselling novel The Orphan Master's Son, Adam Johnson is one of America's most provocative and powerful authors.

In \"Hurricanes Anonymous\" - first included in the Best American Short Stories anthology - a young man searches for the mother of his son in a Louisiana devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. And in the unforgettable title story, Johnson returns to his signature subject, North Korea, depicting two defectors from Pyongyang who are trying to adapt to their new lives in Seoul, while one cannot forget the woman he left behind. <br /><br />Unnerving, riveting, and written with a timeless quality, these stories confirm Johnson as one of America's greatest writers and an indispensable guide to our new century."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["36615"],"name":["Adam Johnson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p5/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p2/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36615.Adam_Johnson"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["83364"],"text_reviews_count":["10710"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["43193279"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.aXGVKh3uT6dUvWBcBL9nVQ"]}]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Sun Nov 20 21:59:57 -0800 2016"],"read_at":["Mon Dec 12 08:46:46 -0800 2016"],"date_added":["Sun Nov 20 21:59:56 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 12 08:46:46 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1817580706"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1817580706"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1813429011"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"9938498","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0307408841"],"isbn13":["9780307408846"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11994","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.0vpEOoB7dFQPYrtuN6P8dg"],"title":["In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin"],"title_without_series":["In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327864303m/9938498.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327864303s/9938498.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9938498-in-the-garden-of-beasts"],"num_pages":["448"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown"],"publication_day":["10"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.82"],"ratings_count":["132228"],"description":["The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.<p>A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.</p><p>Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, <em>In the Garden of Beasts</em> lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.</p>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5869"],"name":["Erik Larson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304371037p5/5869.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304371037p2/5869.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5869.Erik_Larson"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["679787"],"text_reviews_count":["57454"]}]}],"published":["2011"],"work":[{"id":["14831761"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.815WZZGOM8Z1xTly1_dG8w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1475895135","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Nov 16 05:44:10 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Wed Nov 16 05:44:10 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1813429011"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1813429011"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1813427303"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"8909","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375759239"],"isbn13":["9780375759239"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3718","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.9fEZ6zm_Vj0WNoyp1re-5A"],"title":["The War of the Worlds"],"title_without_series":["The War of the Worlds"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320391644m/8909.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320391644s/8909.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds"],"num_pages":["192"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Modern Library"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["3.80"],"ratings_count":["197040"],"description":["With H.G. Wells’ other novels, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines – the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine – they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on.

An experienced falconer—Helen had been captivated by hawks since childhood—she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself \"in the hawk's wild mind to tame her\" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life. <br /><br />Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry.

Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br /><br />In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br /><br />As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <em>The Underground Railroad</em> is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["10029"],"name":["Colson Whitehead"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p5/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p2/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10029.Colson_Whitehead"],"average_rating":["3.92"],"ratings_count":["187539"],"text_reviews_count":["21907"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["48287641"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.w3i1MZHRKRjFbrU4wJf2TA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1396406479","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1729981675"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18693910","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1594203474"],"isbn13":["9781594203473"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1036","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OYgHo_97kTmGbedB1chEww"],"title":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"title_without_series":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620m/18693910.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620s/18693910.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693910-barbarian-days"],"num_pages":["447"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Penguin Press"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["10183"],"description":["<b>A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed<i> New Yorker </i>writer</b><br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days</i> is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.<br /><br />Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.<br /><br />During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4039811"],"name":["Veronica Roth"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p5/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p2/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4039811.Veronica_Roth"],"average_rating":["4.08"],"ratings_count":["4611512"],"text_reviews_count":["256668"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["13155899"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rBaAZasQyoeUWDUqmXfzJA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1389783005","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:32 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:33 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1715633153"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"5659","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0143039091"],"isbn13":["9780143039099"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2969","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Y6Tj1XDUHYcT9fle4yewtg"],"title":["The Wind in the Willows"],"title_without_series":["The Wind in the Willows"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570m/5659.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570s/5659.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5659.The_Wind_in_the_Willows"],"num_pages":["256"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Penguin Classics"],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["153047"],"description":["<i>One of the most celebrated works of classic literature for children</i><br /><br />Meet little Mole, willful Ratty, Badger the perennial bachelor, and petulant Toad.

And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known.<br /><br />From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant. As the milieu widens to embrace fully four generations, Kent Haruf displays an emotional and aesthetic authority to rival the past masters of a classic American tradition.<br /><br />Utterly true to the rhythms and patterns of life, <i>Plainsong</i> is a novel to care about, believe in, and learn from."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["16266"],"name":["Kent Haruf"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1309205400p5/16266.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1309205400p2/16266.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16266.Kent_Haruf"],"average_rating":["4.01"],"ratings_count":["134756"],"text_reviews_count":["16133"]}]}],"published":["2000"],"work":[{"id":["1402373"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.912S96GAxCi6y12wRd8Hyg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jul 18 21:13:00 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Jul 18 21:13:01 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1702594267"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1702594267"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1698219299"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"424","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0374521727"],"isbn13":["9780374521721"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1511","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7b0dBa8lfe-AaM7_90QFEQ"],"title":["Slouching Towards Bethlehem"],"title_without_series":["Slouching Towards Bethlehem"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327952074m/424.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327952074s/424.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424.Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem"],"num_pages":["238"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Farrar Straus Giroux"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["1990"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["4.23"],"ratings_count":["25290"],"description":["This classic collection of journalism defined the state of America during the upheaval of the sixties revolution.

His groundbreaking research exposes ten well-disguised mental Saboteurs. Nearly 95 percent of the executives in his Stanford lectures conclude that these Saboteurs cause “significant harm” to achieving their true potential. With Positive Intelligence, you can learn the secret to defeating these internal foes. Positive Intelligence (PQ)SM measures the percentage of time your mind is serving you as opposed to sabotaging you. While your IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence) contribute to your maximum potential, it is your PQ that determines how much of that potential you actually achieve.<br /><br />The great news is that you can improve your PQ significantly in as little as 21 days. With higher PQ, teams and professionals ranging from leaders to salespeople perform 30 to 35 percent better on average. Importantly, they also report being far happier and less stressed. The breakthrough tools and techniques in this book have been refined over years of coaching hundreds of CEOs and their executive teams. Shirzad tells many of their remarkable stories, showing how you too can take concrete steps to unleash the vast, untapped powers of your mind.<br /><br />Discover how to<br />•    Identify and conquer your top Saboteurs. Common Saboteurs include the Judge, Controller, Victim, Avoider, and Pleaser.  <br />•    Measure the Positive Intelligence score (PQ) for yourself or your team—and see how close you come to the critical tipping point required for peak performance.<br />•    Increase PQ dramatically in as little as 21 days.<br />•    Develop new brain “muscles,” and access 5 untapped powers with energizing mental “power games.”<br />•    Apply PQ tools and techniques to increase both performance and fulfillment.

His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent.

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b><br /><br />Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.<br /><br />In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules,\" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.<br /><br />A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["147891"],"name":["Cal Newport"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p5/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p2/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["47953"],"text_reviews_count":["4676"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45502249"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.k9-gUtwNW3ArJP-Nse69yA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1331089696","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:40 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1651336590"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"27209486","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["159463467X"],"isbn13":["9781594634673"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2433","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EwzMmV6qSEHWJhKSJwzgtA"],"title":["Modern Lovers"],"title_without_series":["Modern Lovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735m/27209486.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735s/27209486.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209486-modern-lovers"],"num_pages":["353"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Riverhead Books"],"publication_day":["31"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.44"],"ratings_count":["29468"],"description":["<b>From the <i>New York Times</i>‒bestselling author of <i>The Vacationers</i>, a smart, highly entertaining novel about a tight-knit group of friends from college—their own kids now going to college—and what it means to finally grow up well after adulthood has set in.</b><br /><br />Friends and former college bandmates Elizabeth and Andrew and Zoe have watched one another marry, buy real estate, and start businesses and families, all while trying to hold on to the identities of their youth. But nothing ages them like having to suddenly pass the torch (of sexuality, independence, and the ineffable alchemy of cool) to their own offspring.<br /><br />Back in the band's heyday, Elizabeth put on a snarl over her Midwestern smile, Andrew let his unwashed hair grow past his chin, and Zoe was the lesbian all the straight women wanted to sleep with.

Walking through the city at night, it's as though he could disappear and no one would even notice.<br /><br />But soon, Jeremy's life begins taking strange turns: boxes containing records of his online activity are delivered to his apartment, a young man seems to be following him, and his elderly mother receives anonymous phone calls slandering her son.

At an opulent resort in Montego Bay, Margot hustles to send her younger sister, Thandi, to school. Taught as a girl to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village, Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for another woman.

At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged—a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl’s life when everything can go horribly wrong."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2926065"],"name":["Emma Cline"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p5/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p2/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2926065.Emma_Cline"],"average_rating":["3.48"],"ratings_count":["124555"],"text_reviews_count":["13972"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["42856015"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.a02kG7jJEMIckrwBpO7ssQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1322174044","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat May 28 09:17:25 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat May 28 09:17:26 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1646668577"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23692271","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9654","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4aaEOknMj7166lgef5EmXw"],"title":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"title_without_series":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954m/23692271.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954s/23692271.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"],"num_pages":["443"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Harvill Secker"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.45"],"ratings_count":["140053"],"description":["100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. <br /><br />How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? <br /><br />In <i>Sapiens</i>, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? <br /><br />Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["395812"],"name":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p5/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p2/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/395812.Yuval_Noah_Harari"],"average_rating":["4.42"],"ratings_count":["183701"],"text_reviews_count":["16585"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["18962767"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.wrue7885k_mhTCRSy0O0VQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1317781208","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon May 23 11:17:59 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon May 23 11:18:00 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1644942608"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"1735330","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0340937688"],"isbn13":["9780340937686"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"517","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.W2m2Hmo_IEoo4GgfR2nBjA"],"title":["The Night Manager"],"title_without_series":["The Night Manager"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1735330.The_Night_Manager"],"num_pages":["597"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Sceptre"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2006"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["10863"],"description":["In the shadowy recesses of Whitehall and Washington an unholy alliance operates between the intelligence community and the secret arms trade.

No one has insight into their true character like the people who serve their meals and make their beds every day. Full of stories and details by turns dramatic, humorous, and heartwarming, <em>The Residence</em> reveals daily life in the White House as it is really lived through the voices of the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others who tend to the needs of the President and First Family.<br /><br />These dedicated professionals maintain the six-floor mansion’s 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, 28 fireplaces, three elevators, and eight staircases, and prepare everything from hors d’oeuvres for intimate gatherings to meals served at elaborate state dinners. Over the course of the day, they gather in the lower level’s basement kitchen to share stories, trade secrets, forge lifelong friendships, and sometimes even fall in love.<br /><br />Combining incredible first-person anecdotes from extensive interviews with scores of White House staff members—many speaking for the first time—with archival research, Kate Andersen Brower tells their story. She reveals the intimacy between the First Family and the people who serve them, as well as tension that has shaken the staff over the decades. From the housekeeper and engineer who fell in love while serving President Reagan to Jackie Kennedy’s private moment of grief with a beloved staffer after her husband’s assassination to the tumultuous days surrounding President Nixon’s resignation and President Clinton’s impeachment battle, <em>The Residence</em> is full of surprising and moving details that illuminate day-to-day life at the White House."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["8378127"],"name":["Kate Andersen Brower"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1487990412p5/8378127.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1487990412p2/8378127.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8378127.Kate_Andersen_Brower"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["18859"],"text_reviews_count":["2597"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["42205784"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DbuIEYrfCGGSmIrpuAtLzg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1176713459","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jan 03 16:04:06 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Jan 03 16:04:07 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1493728804"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1493728804"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1493727166"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"16160797","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316206849"],"isbn13":["9780316206846"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"23910","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YaeOqX02QVR6ZNerJt51KQ"],"title":["The Cuckoo's Calling (Cormoran Strike, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Cuckoo's Calling"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358716559m/16160797.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358716559s/16160797.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling"],"num_pages":["455"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Mulholland Books / Little, Brown and Company"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["384808"],"description":["<i>The Cuckoo's Calling</i> is a 2013 crime fiction novel by J.

The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: \"Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.\" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next. <p> The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches--stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition--with explorations of how and why we read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. <i>If on a Winter's Night</i> is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. \"What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.\"</p>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["155517"],"name":["Italo Calvino"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1501975461p5/155517.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1501975461p2/155517.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/155517.Italo_Calvino"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["220409"],"text_reviews_count":["14818"]}]}],"published":["1982"],"work":[{"id":["1116802"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oqzEienp9YhlsREz7gon0w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1171699716","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu Dec 31 11:42:21 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Thu Dec 31 11:42:21 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1487592791"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1487592791"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1484514888"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2203053","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1602062110"],"isbn13":["9781602062115"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6U1ICCuWmvGVgRlDt4h6tA"],"title":["Your Forces and How to Use Them"],"title_without_series":["Your Forces and How to Use Them"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203053.Your_Forces_and_How_to_Use_Them"],"num_pages":["336"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Cosimo Classics"],"publication_day":["15"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["4.32"],"ratings_count":["109"],"description":["One often hears about the power of positive thinking, but rarely is a book so practical in teaching the reader how to refine such thought and use it as a foundation for achieving success.

And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.<br /><br />Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves. <br /><br />We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square. <br /><br />The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.<br /><br />But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures. <br /><br />Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do. <br /><br />The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["153503"],"name":["Sherry Turkle"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p5/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p2/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/153503.Sherry_Turkle"],"average_rating":["3.71"],"ratings_count":["8093"],"text_reviews_count":["1201"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44223191"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MFGBmbtHc72-dDsDWN9I8w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1168964054","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1484486982"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"15790842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316176486"],"isbn13":["9780316176484"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"19207","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Qk3OvOwJVbNXcvgz7J2rnA"],"title":["Life After Life (Todd Family, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Life After Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808m/15790842.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808s/15790842.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842-life-after-life"],"num_pages":["531"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Reagan Arthur Books"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.75"],"ratings_count":["169514"],"description":["What if you could live again and again, until you got it right? <br /><br />On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born to an English banker and his wife.

Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--\"Scout\"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past--a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision--a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to an American classic."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1825"],"name":["Harper Lee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p5/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p2/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1825.Harper_Lee"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["3831573"],"text_reviews_count":["104365"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44458285"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rjDem32D95tDQK2yL0ZYrQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153935636","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:19 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:20 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1467292667"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"10762469","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0312358342"],"isbn13":["9780312358341"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4796","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t2RUtrEeIFuG-zIk-HMx2w"],"title":["The Leftovers"],"title_without_series":["The Leftovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433m/10762469.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433s/10762469.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10762469-the-leftovers"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["St. Martin's Press"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.39"],"ratings_count":["38941"],"description":["What if — whoosh, right now, with no explanation — a number of us simply vanished? Would some of us collapse? Would others of us go on, one foot in front of the other, as we did before the world turned upside down? That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened — not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children.<br /><br />Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet \"A\" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.<br /><br />With heart, intelligence and a rare ability to illuminate the struggles inherent in ordinary lives, Tom Perrotta has written a startling, thought-provoking novel about love, connection and loss."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["15907"],"name":["Tom Perrotta"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p5/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p2/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15907.Tom_Perrotta"],"average_rating":["3.47"],"ratings_count":["118602"],"text_reviews_count":["13845"]}]}],"published":["2011"],"work":[{"id":["15455523"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.LHzAfuicrOTT_Gh7GKyHBQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153934693","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:43 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:44 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1465557640"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"24861842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0393081087"],"isbn13":["9780393081084"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"260","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.y2fQb5Vvi4TmInN-Px8LoA"],"title":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"title_without_series":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861842-the-food-lab"],"num_pages":["960"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["W.

How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)—and use a foolproof method that works every time?<br /><br />As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J. Kenji López-Alt has pondered all these questions and more. In <em>The Food Lab</em>, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food. Kenji shows that often, conventional methods don’t work that well, and home cooks can achieve far better results using new—but simple—techniques. In hundreds of easy-to-make recipes with over 1,000 full-color images, you will find out how to make foolproof Hollandaise sauce in just two minutes, how to transform one simple tomato sauce into a half dozen dishes, how to make the crispiest, creamiest potato casserole ever conceived, and much more."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7958610"],"name":["J.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway’s governing Labour Party. In <i>The Island</i>, the journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become a terrorist?     <br /><br />As in her bestseller <i>The Bookseller of Kabul</i>, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik’s troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, and then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to “save Norway” from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik’s victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Utøya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country—famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["769979"],"name":["Åsne Seierstad"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p5/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p2/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/769979._sne_Seierstad"],"average_rating":["3.86"],"ratings_count":["46573"],"text_reviews_count":["4082"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["26029348"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qJSqpFQCc5NlM7TWeT6fZQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149468112","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:32 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:33 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459925"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"20758057","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375414142"],"isbn13":["9780375414145"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"258","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-WGbb3R_f2IDW6xP_eJVnw"],"title":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"title_without_series":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945m/20758057.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945s/20758057.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20758057-empire-of-cotton"],"num_pages":["640"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Knopf"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["12"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1710"],"description":["The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality to the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism.<br /><br />Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert’s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.<br /><br />The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.<b>\n  <br /><br /></b>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["97917"],"name":["Sven Beckert"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/97917.Sven_Beckert"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1821"],"text_reviews_count":["324"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["40090517"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.W4svM3LChQzkOQNJQdyNYg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467355","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:23 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:30 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459637"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"25489625","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812993543"],"isbn13":["9780812993547"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11432","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.pJoOfvwjyVRklvxPcmHPjA"],"title":["Between the World and Me"],"title_without_series":["Between the World and Me"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027m/25489625.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027s/25489625.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"],"num_pages":["152"],"format":["Kindle Edition"],"edition_information":["First Edition"],"publisher":["Spiegel & Grau"],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["132116"],"description":["In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br /><br />Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<br /><br />Source: penguinrandomhouse.com"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1214964"],"name":["Ta-Nehisi Coates"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p5/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p2/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1214964.Ta_Nehisi_Coates"],"average_rating":["4.31"],"ratings_count":["174926"],"text_reviews_count":["20876"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44848425"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F-n-hb4HqoKqonNt8NpNkg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467098","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459415"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13586707","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1609450787"],"isbn13":["9781609450786"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8451","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.jcMTG3qOtIZ45fGkDLOV3Q"],"title":["My Brilliant Friend (The Neapolitan Novels #1)"],"title_without_series":["My Brilliant Friend"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947m/13586707.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947s/13586707.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend"],"num_pages":["331"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Europa Editions"],"publication_day":["25"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["114185"],"description":["The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples.

They are likewise the embodiments of a nation undergoing momentous change. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city, and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her protagonists, the unforgettable Elena and Lila."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["44085"],"name":["Elena Ferrante"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44085.Elena_Ferrante"],"average_rating":["4.12"],"ratings_count":["285958"],"text_reviews_count":["27231"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["19174054"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.p9o3XzdSTQ0do_9bjyP6RA"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":["Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 -0700 2017"],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:38 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Oct 23 22:13:28 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459415"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459415"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462458911"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"22237161","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0374260508"],"isbn13":["9780374260507"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4061","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EU3NSqBqEYc32ewpJFIQ-g"],"title":["The Sellout"],"title_without_series":["The Sellout"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403430899m/22237161.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403430899s/22237161.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout"],"num_pages":["304"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Farrar, Straus and Giroux"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.77"],"ratings_count":["37865"],"description":["\"رواية الخائن هي أحد تلك الكتب النادرة التي تمكّنت من اتخاذ السخرية أسلوباً أدبيّ صعبٌ للغاية، ولا يمكن إتقانه دائماً. لقد غاصت الرواية في قلب المجتمع الأمركيّ المعاصر، بطرافة وحشية، لم أقرأ مثلها منذ سويفت وتوين\". بهذه الجمل افتتحت المؤرخة البريطانيّة أماندا فورمان رئيسة الهيئة المانحة لجائزة مان بوكر تعليقَها على فوز رواية \"الخائن\" the sellout للكاتب الأمريكيّ بول بيتي Paul Betty، بجائزتها للعام 2016."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["44076"],"name":["Paul Beatty"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1410926394p5/44076.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1410926394p2/44076.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44076.Paul_Beatty"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["43846"],"text_reviews_count":["5435"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["41610676"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Hv5fu44tnrz_LGPhGu327A"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149466439","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:25:55 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:25:55 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462458911"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462458911"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462458497"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"22929586","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0374202397"],"isbn13":["9780374202392"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1296","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.qhZABTckywXyKuCjM7iC8Q"],"title":["A Manual for Cleaning Women: Selected Stories"],"title_without_series":["A Manual for Cleaning Women: Selected Stories"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437827518m/22929586.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437827518s/22929586.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929586-a-manual-for-cleaning-women"],"num_pages":["432"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Farrar, Straus and Giroux"],"publication_day":["18"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.17"],"ratings_count":["10999"],"description":["A MANUAL FOR CLEANING WOMEN compiles the best work of the legendary short-story writer Lucia Berlin.

The housekeeper's reputation is one built on dependable efficiency, though she is something of an oddity. Stubborn, foul-mouthed and with a flagrant disregard for her employer's opinions she may even be crazy. She allows no-one to set foot inside her house; she masks herself with a veil and is equally guarded about her personal life. And yet Emerence is revered as much as she is feared. As the story progresses her energy and passion to help becomes clear, extinguishing any doubts arising out of her bizarre behaviour. A stylishly told tale which recounts a strange relationship built up over 20 years between a writer and her housekeeper. After an unpromising and caustic start benign feelings develop and ultimately the writer benefits from what becomes an inseparable relationship.

It is here that the lives of two women, with two mysteries, will converge.<br /><br />Nineteen-year-old Night Vale pawn shop owner Jackie Fierro is given a paper marked \"King City\" by a mysterious man in a tan jacket holding a deer skin suitcase. Everything about him and his paper unsettles her, especially the fact that she can't seem to get the paper to leave her hand, and that no one who meets this man can remember anything about him. Jackie is determined to uncover the mystery of King City and the man in the tan jacket before she herself unravels.<br /><br />Night Vale PTA treasurer Diane Crayton's son, Josh, is moody and also a shape shifter.

There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.<br /><br />Considering himself \"a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,\" Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress \"so pure, she didn't know what starving people looked like.\" <br /><br />Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master's Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master's Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today's greatest writers.<br /><br />--jacket description"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["36615"],"name":["Adam Johnson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p5/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1323830690p2/36615.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36615.Adam_Johnson"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["83364"],"text_reviews_count":["10710"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["16467838"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ShGanR4k5-GktkRNUfZ9MA"]}]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Fri Jul 29 13:06:26 -0700 2016"],"read_at":["Mon Aug 08 21:53:16 -0700 2016"],"date_added":["Thu Aug 06 08:01:09 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Aug 08 21:53:17 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1356395217"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1356395217"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1352655625"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18467802","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0802122558"],"isbn13":["9780802122551"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"5280","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4FYklsimWf6SN9DEG2deGw"],"title":["Euphoria"],"title_without_series":["Euphoria"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418788366m/18467802.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418788366s/18467802.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18467802-euphoria"],"num_pages":["256"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Atlantic Monthly Press"],"publication_day":["3"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.84"],"ratings_count":["54273"],"description":["Inspired by the true story of a woman who changed the way we understand our world.<br /><br />In 1933 three young, gifted anthropologists are thrown together in the jungle of New Guinea.

Fans of Paula Hawkins’ <em>The Girl on the Train</em> will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic <em>Strangers on a Train</em> from the author of the acclaimed <em>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</em>—which the <em>Washington Post</em> said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”<br /><br />On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.<br /><br />But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .<br /><br />Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.<br /><br />Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7142445"],"name":["Peter  Swanson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p5/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p2/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7142445.Peter_Swanson"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["79460"],"text_reviews_count":["10501"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["41240456"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mjDL7a8lLd-InoC-l7XHhQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1049698698","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:03 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:04 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1352654128"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"16278318","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804137250"],"isbn13":["9780804137256"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9387","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.mppxwf1f6WLJySVmFqqfQQ"],"title":["Armada"],"title_without_series":["Armada"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428m/16278318.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428s/16278318.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown Publishing "],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.50"],"ratings_count":["74294"],"description":["Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure.<br /><br />But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe.<br /><br />And then he sees the flying saucer.<br /><br />Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i>—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. <br /><br />No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it.<br /><br />It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero.

His house is a maze of sorcerous booby traps and escape tunnels, as yours might be if you were sitting on a treasury of Russian magic stolen from the Soviet Union thirty years ago. Andrew has long known that magic was a brutal game requiring blood sacrifice and a willingness to confront death, but his many years of peace and comfort have left him soft, more concerned with maintaining false youth than with seeing to his own defense. Now a monster straight from the pages of Russian folklore is coming for him, and frost and death are coming with her."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4712375"],"name":["Christopher Buehlman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1350057325p5/4712375.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1350057325p2/4712375.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4712375.Christopher_Buehlman"],"average_rating":["3.77"],"ratings_count":["10102"],"text_reviews_count":["1959"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["24678703"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.4F6b-8eMzsRjFgsDIDxU3Q"]}]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":["Fri Jul 31 23:56:21 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Wed May 06 06:06:18 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jul 31 23:56:21 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1273189392"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1273189392"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1263948926"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18007564","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804139024"],"isbn13":["9780804139021"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"52123","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.O5h1YAnBEe0cYP_KkaVAcA"],"title":["The Martian"],"title_without_series":["The Martian"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054m/18007564.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054s/18007564.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian"],"num_pages":["369"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["US / CAN Edition"],"publisher":["Crown"],"publication_day":["11"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["599805"],"description":["Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. <br /><br />Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.<br /><br />After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. <br /><br />Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death.

J. Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.<br /><br />We are not quite novels.<br /><br />We are not quite short stories.<br /><br />In the end, we are collected works.<br /><br />A. J. Fikry's life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died; his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history; and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Chief Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who's always felt kindly toward him; from Ismay, his sister-in-law, who is hell-bent on saving A.J. from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who persists in taking the ferry to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.'s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, he can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It's a small package, though large in weight—an unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn't take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J., for the determined sales rep Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light, for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.'s world.

Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an \"other\" New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck's particular brand of naivete and chutzpah by his ability to a hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider's vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory. Joseph O'Neill's prose, in its conscientiousness and beauty, involves us utterly in the struggle for meaning that governs any single life."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["389474"],"name":["Joseph O'Neill"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p5/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p2/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/389474.Joseph_O_Neill"],"average_rating":["3.40"],"ratings_count":["19005"],"text_reviews_count":["2876"]}]}],"published":["2008"],"work":[{"id":["2639658"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ro7BmRbyQxkIEjIy5pz3Dw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373125","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:52 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:53 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999997"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6601090","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kUbmJ18tU2hujEY8DdIMbA"],"title":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"title_without_series":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333m/6601090.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333s/6601090.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6601090-the-beckham-experiment"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.95"],"ratings_count":["1930"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2886182"],"name":["Grant Wahl"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p5/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p2/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2886182.Grant_Wahl"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["2038"],"text_reviews_count":["128"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["6554311"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U2EhrsHrWP3IqA4FKiMJqw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373085","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:50 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:51 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999945"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6435088","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"93","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.wEN74oUw1SPLzLTy38r2Ig"],"title":["The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Alchemyst"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665m/6435088.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665s/6435088.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6435088-the-alchemyst"],"num_pages":["402"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Canadian Edition"],"publisher":["Delacorte Books for Young Readers"],"publication_day":["20"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.84"],"ratings_count":["122037"],"description":["He holds the secret that can end the world.<br /><br />The truth: Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on September 28, 1330.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["171"],"text_reviews_count":["31"]}]}],"published":["2009"],"work":[{"id":["7075790"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.t2hTwbpM0FO8v8EFznV0zA"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:20 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:34 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151998549"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"8147904","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"117","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lADnwkLmBvcjg5oIsCQBOw"],"title":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"title_without_series":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007m/8147904.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007s/8147904.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8147904-06-20-000-meilen-unter-dem-meer"],"num_pages":[""],"format":["Audiobook"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["EUROPA Logo!"],"publication_day":["10"],"publication_year":["2010"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.87"],"ratings_count":["160929"],"description":["Man schreibt das Jahr 1867.

The devil will do all he asks on Earth and seeks to grant him a moment in life so glorious that he will wish it to last forever. But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe’s great work, the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a rejuvenated life and winning the love of the beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire, and self-delusion, Faust heads inexorably toward an infernal destruction.<br /><br />The best translation of Faust available, this volume provides the original German text and its English counterpart on facing pages. Walter Kaufmann's translation conveys the poetic beauty and rhythm as well as the complex depth of Goethe's language. Includes Part One and selections from Part Two."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["285217"],"name":["Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454800433p5/285217.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454800433p2/285217.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/285217.Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe"],"average_rating":["3.80"],"ratings_count":["170025"],"text_reviews_count":["6550"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["24158213"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.KFow0wEZpZ9K5_H724RN9A"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871371798","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:48:54 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:48:55 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998110"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998110"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151997887"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"9847105","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"107","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.7JsmL_HwjwpX1uVzrd5egw"],"title":["The Hawk and His Boy (The Tormay Trilogy, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Hawk and His Boy"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336452925m/9847105.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336452925s/9847105.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9847105-the-hawk-and-his-boy"],"num_pages":["225"],"format":["Kindle Edition"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":["19"],"publication_year":["2010"],"publication_month":["11"],"average_rating":["3.58"],"ratings_count":["1310"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4496909"],"name":["Christopher Bunn"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1348432524p5/4496909.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1348432524p2/4496909.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4496909.Christopher_Bunn"],"average_rating":["3.71"],"ratings_count":["3060"],"text_reviews_count":["283"]}]}],"published":["2010"],"work":[{"id":["14737993"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.nMr1-MHRZXhr-ReAXrqNwQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871371655","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:48:47 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:48:48 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151997887"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151997887"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151997804"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18608116","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.RNmTRxz0o7Ut0LZVkJzKAQ"],"title":["Faust"],"title_without_series":["Faust"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18608116-faust"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.97"],"ratings_count":["24049"],"description":["This book was converted from its physical edition to the digital format by a community of volunteers.

Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.<br /><br />Doerr’s “stunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>) are dazzling.

A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. <br /><br />He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. <br /><br />At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions.

He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again.

But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the enecplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />--jacket flap"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["585"],"name":["John Steinbeck"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["3128706"],"text_reviews_count":["85140"]}]}],"published":["2002"],"work":[{"id":["2574991"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.vt9gftgAURa2UyAzsYRzkw"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Apr 06 21:31:28 -0700 2015"],"read_at":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Tue Nov 11 19:04:51 -0800 2014"],"date_updated":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090950575"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2932","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375757325"],"isbn13":["9780375757327"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3510","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ZhW-W1AgOMy8jJLwQT3ofQ"],"title":["Robinson Crusoe"],"title_without_series":["Robinson Crusoe"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114m/2932.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114s/2932.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2932.Robinson_Crusoe"],"num_pages":["320"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Modern Library"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2001"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.66"],"ratings_count":["211825"],"description":["Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name \"Kreutznaer\") sets sail from the Queen's Dock in Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who want him to pursue a career, possibly in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his lust for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Sale pirates (the Sale Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation. Robinson Crusoe is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25 April 1719.

I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a megabyte."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1127821"],"name":["Leland Wilkinson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1127821.Leland_Wilkinson"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["60"],"text_reviews_count":["5"]}]}],"published":["2005"],"work":[{"id":["2556993"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.x2EBm3lHD3LaP9Ekpee2tg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"819502748","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"date_updated":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090948872"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13497818","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316228532"],"isbn13":["9780316228534"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"26267","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TK5noI1A9syGxzSebYW9xQ"],"title":["The Casual Vacancy"],"title_without_series":["The Casual Vacancy"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913m/13497818.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913s/13497818.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497818-the-casual-vacancy"],"num_pages":["503"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["First Edition (US)"],"publisher":["Little, Brown and Company"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.29"],"ratings_count":["269907"],"description":["<b>A BIG NOVEL ABOUT A SMALL TOWN ...</b><br /><br />When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.<br /><br />Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty façade is a town at war.<br /><br />Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ...

The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. <i>Cut back</i>! was his mantra. <i>Otherwise everyone will lose</i>! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. <i>Innovate</i>! was Borlaug's cry. <i>Only in that way can everyone win</i>! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <em>Norse Mythology</em>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B01HQA6EOC <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39673345-norse-mythology\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4810155"],"text_reviews_count":["282051"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["51396954"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZjetaSgZLpRuwbsCvexmjg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1949850409","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"date_updated":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2277996853"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"34146863","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1943888108"],"isbn13":["9781943888108"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5Iu0dxorgFKOSw0F37NV_A"],"title":["Mammother"],"title_without_series":["Mammother"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165m/34146863.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165s/34146863.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34146863-mammother"],"num_pages":["328"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Featherproof Books"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2017"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["50"],"description":["The people of Pie Time are suffering from God's Finger, a mysterious plague that leaves its victims dead with a big hole through their chests.

A sleepy coastal town, where crime usually consists of underage drinking down at a Wolf Point bonfire. But then strange things start happening—a human skeleton is unearthed in a local park and mutilated animals begin appearing, seemingly sacrificed, on the town’s beaches. <br /><br /><i>The Mercy of the Tide</i> follows four people drawn irrevocably together by a recent tragedy as they do their best to reclaim their lives—leading them all to a discovery that will change them and their town forever. At the heart of the story are Sam Finster, a senior in high school mourning the death of his mother, and his sister Trina, a nine-year-old deaf girl who denies her grief by dreaming of a nuclear apocalypse as Cold War tensions rise. Meanwhile, Sheriff Dave Dobbs and officer Nick Hayslip must try to put their own sorrows aside to figure out who, or what, is wreaking havoc on their once-idyllic town. <br /><br />Keith Rosson paints outside the typical genre lines with his brilliant debut novel.

Huck, abandoned and “dreadful lonely,” hires himself out to “whosoever.” He rides shotgun on coaches, wrangles horses on a Chisholm Trail cattle drive, joins a gang of bandits, guides wagon trains, gets dragged into U.S. Army massacres, and suffers a series of romantic and barroom misadventures.<br /><br />He is eventually drawn into a Lakota tribe by a young brave, Eeteh, an inventive teller of Coyote tales who “was having about the same kind of trouble with his tribe as I was having with mine.” There is an army colonel who wants to hang Huck and destroy Eeteh’s tribe, so they’re both on the run, finding themselves ultimately in the Black Hills just ahead of the 1876 Gold Rush.<br /><br />This period, from the middle of the Civil War to the centennial year of 1876, is probably the most formative era of the nation’s history. In the West, it is a time of grand adventure, but also one of greed, religious insanity, mass slaughter, virulent hatreds, widespread poverty and ignorance, ruthless military and civilian leadership, huge disparities of wealth.

Meanwhile, her husband's decade-long dedication to his invention, the causality violation device (which he would greatly prefer you not call a “time machine”) has effectively stalled his career and made him a laughingstock in the physics community.

Taking on the persona of a shy human boy, a childlike but massively powerful artificial intelligence known as Archos comes online and assumes control over the global network of machines that regulate everything from transportation to utilities, defense and communication. <br /><br />In the months leading up to this, sporadic glitches are noticed by a handful of unconnected humans – a single mother disconcerted by her daughter’s menacing “smart” toys, a lonely Japanese bachelor who is victimized by his domestic robot companion, an isolated U.S. soldier who witnesses a ‘pacification unit’ go haywire – but most are unaware of the growing rebellion until it is too late.<br /><br />When the Robot War ignites -- at a moment known later as Zero Hour -- humankind will be both decimated and, possibly, for the first time in history, united. Robopocalypse is a brilliantly conceived action-filled epic, a terrifying story with heart-stopping implications for the real technology all around us…and an entertaining and engaging thriller unlike anything else written in years."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["33773"],"name":["Daniel H.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student \"possessed,\" as he wrote, \"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. <br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. <br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\" he wrote. \"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["14031444"],"name":["Paul Kalanithi"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p5/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p2/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14031444.Paul_Kalanithi"],"average_rating":["4.33"],"ratings_count":["240784"],"text_reviews_count":["21833"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45424659"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oip55amienPK71A-wDcRGg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1715512408","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:23 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:24 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2010516934"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"28094574","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"512","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kGP1I1c7HpCBdduAyT6bXA"],"title":["It"],"title_without_series":["It"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28094574-it"],"num_pages":["1169"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["586399"],"description":["Welcome to Derry, Maine.

Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.<br /><br />At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.<br /><br />Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.<br /><br />Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.<br /><br />Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["33919"],"name":["Jeff VanderMeer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p5/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p2/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33919.Jeff_VanderMeer"],"average_rating":["3.68"],"ratings_count":["222079"],"text_reviews_count":["27111"]}]}],"published":["2017"],"work":[{"id":["48253660"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.plCUzpp1YC5oeLO-juikmg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1665142399","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1971644292"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"12591698","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1841499900"],"isbn13":["9781841499901"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3138","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.0XisucKtvM8-4g28MVMe8A"],"title":["Caliban's War (The Expanse, #2)"],"title_without_series":["Caliban's War"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377m/12591698.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377s/12591698.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12591698-caliban-s-war"],"num_pages":["595"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Orbit (Hachette)"],"publication_day":["26"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.30"],"ratings_count":["61969"],"description":["We are not alone.<br /><br />On Ganymede, breadbasket of the outer planets, a Martian marine watches as her platoon is slaughtered by a monstrous supersoldier.

Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.<br /><br />Spanning five decades, <em>Commonwealth</em> explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the strange and genuine affection that grows up between them.<br /><br />When, in her twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book, ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt, and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another.<br /><br />Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, <em>Commonwealth</em> is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories.

Sharing their interwoven fate — and increasingly torn by her feelings — is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond.<br /><br />Hauntingly evocative of medieval Spain, <b>The Lions of Al-Rassan</b> is both a brilliant adventure and a deeply compelling story of love, divided loyalties, and what happens to men and women when hardening beliefs begin to remake — or destroy — a world."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["174090"],"text_reviews_count":["10529"]}]}],"published":["2005"],"work":[{"id":["955081"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.cy3sXFt84hKE2BU_tMOUVQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jan 02 08:39:48 -0800 2017"],"date_updated":["Mon Jan 02 08:40:02 -0800 2017"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1861682217"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1861682217"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1848973630"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"5094","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0451210859"],"isbn13":["9780451210852"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4502","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.F20HkL7ti1j96wj37K1K8Q"],"title":["The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, #2)"],"title_without_series":["The Drawing of the Three"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1370918050m/5094.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1370918050s/5094.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5094.The_Drawing_of_the_Three"],"num_pages":["463"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Signet"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.23"],"ratings_count":["177308"],"description":["In 1978, Stephen King introduced the world to the last gunslinger, Roland of Gilead.  Nothing has been the same since.

The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life. I was ten years old.”<br /><br />Master storyteller Madeleine Thien takes us inside an extended family in China, showing us the lives of two successive generations—those who lived through Mao’s Cultural Revolution and their children, who became the students protesting in Tiananmen Square. At the center of this epic story are two young women, Marie and Ai-Ming. Through their relationship Marie strives to piece together the tale of her fractured family in present-day Vancouver, seeking answers in the fragile layers of their collective story. Her quest will unveil how Kai, her enigmatic father, a talented pianist, and Ai-Ming’s father, the shy and brilliant composer, Sparrow, along with the violin prodigy Zhuli were forced to reimagine their artistic and private selves during China’s political campaigns and how their fates reverberate through the years with lasting consequences.<br /><br />With maturity and sophistication, humor and beauty, Thien has crafted a novel that is at once intimate and grandly political, rooted in the details of life inside China yet transcendent in its universality."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["265535"],"name":["Madeleine Thien"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p5/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p2/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/265535.Madeleine_Thien"],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["13394"],"text_reviews_count":["2168"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["47869112"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1OOYQ0w6YUe93bciWWw9aQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1504037013","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:39 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:40 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1839709882"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"11566","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0451933028"],"isbn13":["9780451933027"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3817","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.sUre5ipqFqF26Shanfil-A"],"title":["The Green Mile"],"title_without_series":["The Green Mile"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563m/11566.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563s/11566.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11566.The_Green_Mile"],"num_pages":["592"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Six Volume Box Set "],"publisher":["Penguin Signet"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["1996"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.43"],"ratings_count":["206385"],"description":["When it first appeared, one volume per month, Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE was an unprecedented publishing triumph: all six volumes ended up on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller lists—simultaneously—and delighted millions of fans the world over.<br /><br />Welcome to Cold Mountain Penitentiary, home to the Depression-worn men of E Block.

The next morning the snow child is gone - but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. <br /><br />This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness.

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.<br /><br />Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.<br /><br />As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, <i>Lexicon</i> is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["18741"],"name":["Max Barry"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p5/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p2/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18741.Max_Barry"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["52704"],"text_reviews_count":["6071"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["20077336"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U1mmjxA6FhnAztz2O0MmQQ"]}]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:53 -0800 2016"],"read_at":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:13 -0800 2016"],"date_added":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:52 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:14 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1817580706"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23590496","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0857522973"],"isbn13":["9780857522979"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"804","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4OHq6Ghbd-Nq84nG8un-tQ"],"title":["Fortune Smiles"],"title_without_series":["Fortune Smiles"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824m/23590496.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824s/23590496.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23590496-fortune-smiles"],"num_pages":["304"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Doubleday"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["7732"],"description":["Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his acclaimed and bestselling novel The Orphan Master's Son, Adam Johnson is one of America's most provocative and powerful authors.

In \"Hurricanes Anonymous\" - first included in the Best American Short Stories anthology - a young man searches for the mother of his son in a Louisiana devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.<p>A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.</p><p>Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, <em>In the Garden of Beasts</em> lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity.

With the help of their own interpretations, digital effects, and the talents of a professional actress and choreographer, the Burgess Correctional Players prepare to video their Tempest. Not surprisingly, they view Caliban as the character with whom they have the most in common. However, Felix has another twist in mind, and his enemies are about to find themselves taking part in an interactive and illusion-ridden version of The Tempest that will change their lives forever.

She “inspires cultic devotion in readers” (The New Yorker) and is “the most important crime novelist to emerge in the past 10 years” (Washington Post).<br /><br />“Atmospheric and unputdownable.” —People <br /></b><br />In bestselling Tana French’s newest “tour de force” (The New York Times), being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point. <br /><br />Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.<br /><br />And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road.

Fronted by his pasty, vampiric manager, Edgar Falk, Bruno arrives in Berlin after a troubling run of bad luck in Singapore. Perhaps it was the chance encounter with his crass childhood acquaintance Keith Stolarsky and his smoldering girlfriend Tira Harpaz. Or perhaps it was the emergence of a blot that distorts his vision so he has to look at the board sideways.<br /><br />Things don't go much better in Berlin. Bruno's flirtation with Madchen, the striking blonde he meets on the ferry, is inconclusive; the game at the unsettling Herr Kohler's mansion goes awry as his blot grows worse; he passes out and is sent to the local hospital, where he is given an extremely depressing diagnosis. Having run through Falk's money, Bruno turns to Stolarsky, who, for reasons of his own, agrees to fly Bruno to Berkeley, and to pay for the experimental surgery that might save his life.<br /><br />Berkeley, where Bruno discovered his psychic abilities, and to which he vowed never to return. Amidst the patchouli flashbacks and Anarchist gambits of the local scene, between Tira's come-ons and Keith's machinations, Bruno confronts two existential questions: Is the gambler being played by life? And what if you're telepathic but it doesn't do you any good?"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["6404"],"name":["Jonathan Lethem"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1431787014p5/6404.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1431787014p2/6404.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6404.Jonathan_Lethem"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["205961"],"text_reviews_count":["21038"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["49039223"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.9gCb07ogWXlrNJ9XYrvP5A"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1463001657","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Nov 01 09:36:00 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Nov 01 09:36:01 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1799964015"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1799964015"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1777065402"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18952341","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1481424270"],"isbn13":["9781481424271"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1145","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.VEhHAwYOGvIf-yBAASiJrg"],"title":["The Grace of Kings (The Dandelion Dynasty, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Grace of Kings"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403024981m/18952341.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403024981s/18952341.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings"],"num_pages":["623"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Simon & Schuster"],"publication_day":["7"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["8670"],"description":["Two men rebel together against tyranny—and then become rivals—in this first sweeping book of an epic fantasy series from Ken Liu, recipient of Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards.<br /><br />Wily, charming Kuni Garu, a bandit, and stern, fearless Mata Zyndu, the son of a deposed duke, seem like polar opposites.

A decade later, their marriage is still the envy of their friends, but with an electric thrill we understand that things are even more complicated and remarkable than they have seemed."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["690619"],"name":["Lauren Groff"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1330389831p5/690619.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1330389831p2/690619.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/690619.Lauren_Groff"],"average_rating":["3.60"],"ratings_count":["132233"],"text_reviews_count":["17779"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["43913972"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.CeUPWxZSMDyqdgDhXVykvw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1413601381","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Sep 04 08:20:02 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Sep 04 08:20:03 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1748194298"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1748194298"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1729982281"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18803640","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0224097008"],"isbn13":["9780224097000"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"5641","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8S8Li0EZOc5WqtEIi9UO4w"],"title":["H is for Hawk"],"title_without_series":["H is for Hawk"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18803640-h-is-for-hawk"],"num_pages":["300"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Jonathan Cape"],"publication_day":["31"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.73"],"ratings_count":["44948"],"description":["Obsession, madness, memory, myth, and history combine to achieve a distinctive blend of nature writing and memoir from an outstanding literary innovator.<br /><br />When Helen Macdonald's father died suddenly on a London street, she was devastated. An experienced falconer—Helen had been captivated by hawks since childhood—she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself \"in the hawk's wild mind to tame her\" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life. <br /><br />Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry.

Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br /><br />In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br /><br />As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <em>The Underground Railroad</em> is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["10029"],"name":["Colson Whitehead"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p5/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p2/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10029.Colson_Whitehead"],"average_rating":["3.92"],"ratings_count":["187539"],"text_reviews_count":["21907"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["48287641"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.w3i1MZHRKRjFbrU4wJf2TA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1396406479","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1729981675"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18693910","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1594203474"],"isbn13":["9781594203473"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1036","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OYgHo_97kTmGbedB1chEww"],"title":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"title_without_series":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620m/18693910.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620s/18693910.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693910-barbarian-days"],"num_pages":["447"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Penguin Press"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["10183"],"description":["<b>A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed<i> New Yorker </i>writer</b><br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days</i> is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.<br /><br />Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.<br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days </i>is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7378"],"name":["William Finnegan"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7378.William_Finnegan"],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["10592"],"text_reviews_count":["1267"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["26542461"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IKvs1evjU9M-r1exWf115Q"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1396406234","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:16 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:16 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981675"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981675"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1726804035"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"11084145","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1451648537"],"isbn13":["9781451648539"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"14772","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.55oEh7mAhPW_FkeSWIhWPQ"],"title":["Steve Jobs"],"title_without_series":["Steve Jobs"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511288482m/11084145.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511288482s/11084145.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"],"num_pages":["656"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Simon & Schuster"],"publication_day":["24"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["701861"],"description":["From best-selling author Walter Isaacson comes the landmark biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.<br /><br />In <i>Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography</i>, Isaacson provides an extraordinary account of Jobs' professional and personal life.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.<br /><br />During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4039811"],"name":["Veronica Roth"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p5/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p2/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4039811.Veronica_Roth"],"average_rating":["4.08"],"ratings_count":["4611512"],"text_reviews_count":["256668"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["13155899"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rBaAZasQyoeUWDUqmXfzJA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1389783005","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:32 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:33 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1715633153"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"5659","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0143039091"],"isbn13":["9780143039099"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2969","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Y6Tj1XDUHYcT9fle4yewtg"],"title":["The Wind in the Willows"],"title_without_series":["The Wind in the Willows"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570m/5659.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570s/5659.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5659.The_Wind_in_the_Willows"],"num_pages":["256"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Penguin Classics"],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["153047"],"description":["<i>One of the most celebrated works of classic literature for children</i><br /><br />Meet little Mole, willful Ratty, Badger the perennial bachelor, and petulant Toad.

His groundbreaking research exposes ten well-disguised mental Saboteurs. Nearly 95 percent of the executives in his Stanford lectures conclude that these Saboteurs cause “significant harm” to achieving their true potential. With Positive Intelligence, you can learn the secret to defeating these internal foes. Positive Intelligence (PQ)SM measures the percentage of time your mind is serving you as opposed to sabotaging you. While your IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence) contribute to your maximum potential, it is your PQ that determines how much of that potential you actually achieve.<br /><br />The great news is that you can improve your PQ significantly in as little as 21 days. With higher PQ, teams and professionals ranging from leaders to salespeople perform 30 to 35 percent better on average. Importantly, they also report being far happier and less stressed. The breakthrough tools and techniques in this book have been refined over years of coaching hundreds of CEOs and their executive teams.

His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent.

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b><br /><br />Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.<br /><br />In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules,\" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.<br /><br />A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["147891"],"name":["Cal Newport"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p5/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p2/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["47953"],"text_reviews_count":["4676"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45502249"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.k9-gUtwNW3ArJP-Nse69yA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1331089696","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:40 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1651336590"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"27209486","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["159463467X"],"isbn13":["9781594634673"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2433","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EwzMmV6qSEHWJhKSJwzgtA"],"title":["Modern Lovers"],"title_without_series":["Modern Lovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735m/27209486.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735s/27209486.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209486-modern-lovers"],"num_pages":["353"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Riverhead Books"],"publication_day":["31"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.44"],"ratings_count":["29468"],"description":["<b>From the <i>New York Times</i>‒bestselling author of <i>The Vacationers</i>, a smart, highly entertaining novel about a tight-knit group of friends from college—their own kids now going to college—and what it means to finally grow up well after adulthood has set in.</b><br /><br />Friends and former college bandmates Elizabeth and Andrew and Zoe have watched one another marry, buy real estate, and start businesses and families, all while trying to hold on to the identities of their youth. But nothing ages them like having to suddenly pass the torch (of sexuality, independence, and the ineffable alchemy of cool) to their own offspring.<br /><br />Back in the band's heyday, Elizabeth put on a snarl over her Midwestern smile, Andrew let his unwashed hair grow past his chin, and Zoe was the lesbian all the straight women wanted to sleep with. Now nearing fifty, they all live within shouting distance in the same neighborhood deep in gentrified Brooklyn, and the trappings of the adult world seem to have arrived with ease. But the summer that their children reach maturity (and start sleeping together), the fabric of the adults' lives suddenly begins to unravel, and the secrets and revelations that are finally let loose—about themselves, and about the famous fourth band member who soared and fell without them—can never be reclaimed.<br /><br />Straub packs wisdom and insight and humor together in a satisfying book about neighbors and nosiness, ambition and pleasure, the excitement of youth, the shock of middle age, and the fact that our passions—be they food, or friendship, or music—never go away, they just evolve and grow along with us."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1983563"],"name":["Emma Straub"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1462317840p5/1983563.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1462317840p2/1983563.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1983563.Emma_Straub"],"average_rating":["3.27"],"ratings_count":["91791"],"text_reviews_count":["9528"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["47250967"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oVxBFVju5i6AbtIM4YjhtQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1322176020","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat May 28 09:20:05 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat May 28 09:20:05 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651336590"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651336590"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1651336232"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"27209269","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1101905859"],"isbn13":["9781101905852"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"145","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.erxs1as4voAcskes_r68AQ"],"title":["I Am No One"],"title_without_series":["I Am No One"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451056020m/27209269.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451056020s/27209269.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209269-i-am-no-one"],"num_pages":["352"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Tim Duggan Books"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["2.90"],"ratings_count":["1004"],"description":["<b>A mesmerizing novel about memory, privacy, fear, and what happens when our past catches up with us.</b><br /><br />After a decade living in England, Jeremy O'Keefe returns to New York, where he has been hired as a professor of German history at New York University. Though comfortable in his new life, and happy to be near his daughter once again, Jeremy continues to feel the quiet pangs of loneliness. Walking through the city at night, it's as though he could disappear and no one would even notice.<br /><br />But soon, Jeremy's life begins taking strange turns: boxes containing records of his online activity are delivered to his apartment, a young man seems to be following him, and his elderly mother receives anonymous phone calls slandering her son. Why, he wonders, would anyone want to watch him so closely, and, even more upsetting, why would they alert him to the fact that he was being watched?<br /><br />As Jeremy takes stock of the entanglements that marked his years abroad, he wonders if he has unwittingly committed a crime so serious that he might soon be faced with his own denaturalization. Moving towards a shattering reassessment of what it means to be free in a time of ever more intrusive surveillance, Jeremy is forced to ask himself whether he is 'no one', as he believes, or a traitor not just to his country but to everyone around him."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4800425"],"name":["Patrick Flanery"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332375700p5/4800425.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1332375700p2/4800425.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4800425.Patrick_Flanery"],"average_rating":["3.30"],"ratings_count":["2389"],"text_reviews_count":["582"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["47250684"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Npmsl6PL85p55Aedb5Z0Sg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1322175701","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat May 28 09:19:34 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat May 28 09:19:35 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651336232"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651336232"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1651335372"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"26530351","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1631491768"],"isbn13":["9781631491764"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"671","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4h3ze9MJHnAXyZMaYIxcng"],"title":["Here Comes the Sun"],"title_without_series":["Here Comes the Sun"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463185922m/26530351.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463185922s/26530351.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530351-here-comes-the-sun"],"num_pages":["352"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Liveright"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.82"],"ratings_count":["4687"],"description":["Capturing the distinct rhythms of Jamaican life and dialect, Nicole Dennis-Benn pens a tender hymn to a world hidden among pristine beaches and the wide expanse of turquoise seas. At an opulent resort in Montego Bay, Margot hustles to send her younger sister, Thandi, to school. Taught as a girl to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village, Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for another woman. As they face the impending destruction of their community, each woman fighting to balance the burdens she shoulders with the freedom she craves must confront long-hidden scars. From a much-heralded new writer, Here Comes the Sun offers a dramatic glimpse into a vibrant, passionate world most outsiders see simply as paradise."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["14343402"],"name":["Nicole Y.

At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged—a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl’s life when everything can go horribly wrong."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2926065"],"name":["Emma Cline"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p5/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p2/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2926065.Emma_Cline"],"average_rating":["3.48"],"ratings_count":["124555"],"text_reviews_count":["13972"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["42856015"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.a02kG7jJEMIckrwBpO7ssQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1322174044","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat May 28 09:17:25 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat May 28 09:17:26 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1646668577"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23692271","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9654","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4aaEOknMj7166lgef5EmXw"],"title":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"title_without_series":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954m/23692271.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954s/23692271.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"],"num_pages":["443"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Harvill Secker"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.45"],"ratings_count":["140053"],"description":["100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. <br /><br />How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? <br /><br />In <i>Sapiens</i>, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? <br /><br />Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["395812"],"name":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p5/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p2/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/395812.Yuval_Noah_Harari"],"average_rating":["4.42"],"ratings_count":["183701"],"text_reviews_count":["16585"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["18962767"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.wrue7885k_mhTCRSy0O0VQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1317781208","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon May 23 11:17:59 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon May 23 11:18:00 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1644942608"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"1735330","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0340937688"],"isbn13":["9780340937686"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"517","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.W2m2Hmo_IEoo4GgfR2nBjA"],"title":["The Night Manager"],"title_without_series":["The Night Manager"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1735330.The_Night_Manager"],"num_pages":["597"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Sceptre"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2006"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["10863"],"description":["In the shadowy recesses of Whitehall and Washington an unholy alliance operates between the intelligence community and the secret arms trade.

No one has insight into their true character like the people who serve their meals and make their beds every day. Full of stories and details by turns dramatic, humorous, and heartwarming, <em>The Residence</em> reveals daily life in the White House as it is really lived through the voices of the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others who tend to the needs of the President and First Family.<br /><br />These dedicated professionals maintain the six-floor mansion’s 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, 28 fireplaces, three elevators, and eight staircases, and prepare everything from hors d’oeuvres for intimate gatherings to meals served at elaborate state dinners. Over the course of the day, they gather in the lower level’s basement kitchen to share stories, trade secrets, forge lifelong friendships, and sometimes even fall in love.<br /><br />Combining incredible first-person anecdotes from extensive interviews with scores of White House staff members—many speaking for the first time—with archival research, Kate Andersen Brower tells their story. She reveals the intimacy between the First Family and the people who serve them, as well as tension that has shaken the staff over the decades.

The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: \"Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.\" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal.

And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.<br /><br />Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves. <br /><br />We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square. <br /><br />The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.<br /><br />But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures. <br /><br />Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do. <br /><br />The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["153503"],"name":["Sherry Turkle"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p5/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p2/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/153503.Sherry_Turkle"],"average_rating":["3.71"],"ratings_count":["8093"],"text_reviews_count":["1201"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44223191"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MFGBmbtHc72-dDsDWN9I8w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1168964054","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1484486982"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"15790842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316176486"],"isbn13":["9780316176484"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"19207","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Qk3OvOwJVbNXcvgz7J2rnA"],"title":["Life After Life (Todd Family, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Life After Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808m/15790842.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808s/15790842.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842-life-after-life"],"num_pages":["531"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Reagan Arthur Books"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.75"],"ratings_count":["169514"],"description":["What if you could live again and again, until you got it right? <br /><br />On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born to an English banker and his wife.

Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--\"Scout\"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past--a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision--a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to an American classic."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1825"],"name":["Harper Lee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p5/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p2/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1825.Harper_Lee"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["3831573"],"text_reviews_count":["104365"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44458285"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rjDem32D95tDQK2yL0ZYrQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153935636","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:19 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:20 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1467292667"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"10762469","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0312358342"],"isbn13":["9780312358341"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4796","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t2RUtrEeIFuG-zIk-HMx2w"],"title":["The Leftovers"],"title_without_series":["The Leftovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433m/10762469.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433s/10762469.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10762469-the-leftovers"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["St. Martin's Press"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.39"],"ratings_count":["38941"],"description":["What if — whoosh, right now, with no explanation — a number of us simply vanished? Would some of us collapse? Would others of us go on, one foot in front of the other, as we did before the world turned upside down? That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened — not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children.<br /><br />Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet \"A\" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.<br /><br />With heart, intelligence and a rare ability to illuminate the struggles inherent in ordinary lives, Tom Perrotta has written a startling, thought-provoking novel about love, connection and loss."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["15907"],"name":["Tom Perrotta"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p5/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p2/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15907.Tom_Perrotta"],"average_rating":["3.47"],"ratings_count":["118602"],"text_reviews_count":["13845"]}]}],"published":["2011"],"work":[{"id":["15455523"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.LHzAfuicrOTT_Gh7GKyHBQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153934693","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:43 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:44 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1465557640"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"24861842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0393081087"],"isbn13":["9780393081084"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"260","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.y2fQb5Vvi4TmInN-Px8LoA"],"title":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"title_without_series":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861842-the-food-lab"],"num_pages":["960"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["W.

How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)—and use a foolproof method that works every time?<br /><br />As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J. Kenji López-Alt has pondered all these questions and more. In <em>The Food Lab</em>, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food. Kenji shows that often, conventional methods don’t work that well, and home cooks can achieve far better results using new—but simple—techniques. In hundreds of easy-to-make recipes with over 1,000 full-color images, you will find out how to make foolproof Hollandaise sauce in just two minutes, how to transform one simple tomato sauce into a half dozen dishes, how to make the crispiest, creamiest potato casserole ever conceived, and much more."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7958610"],"name":["J.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway’s governing Labour Party. In <i>The Island</i>, the journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become a terrorist?     <br /><br />As in her bestseller <i>The Bookseller of Kabul</i>, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik’s troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, and then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to “save Norway” from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik’s victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Utøya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country—famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["769979"],"name":["Åsne Seierstad"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p5/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p2/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/769979._sne_Seierstad"],"average_rating":["3.86"],"ratings_count":["46573"],"text_reviews_count":["4082"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["26029348"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qJSqpFQCc5NlM7TWeT6fZQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149468112","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:32 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:33 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459925"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"20758057","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375414142"],"isbn13":["9780375414145"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"258","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-WGbb3R_f2IDW6xP_eJVnw"],"title":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"title_without_series":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945m/20758057.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945s/20758057.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20758057-empire-of-cotton"],"num_pages":["640"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Knopf"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["12"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1710"],"description":["The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality to the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism.<br /><br />Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert’s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.<br /><br />The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.<b>\n  <br /><br /></b>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["97917"],"name":["Sven Beckert"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/97917.Sven_Beckert"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1821"],"text_reviews_count":["324"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["40090517"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.W4svM3LChQzkOQNJQdyNYg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467355","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:23 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:30 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459637"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"25489625","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812993543"],"isbn13":["9780812993547"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11432","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.pJoOfvwjyVRklvxPcmHPjA"],"title":["Between the World and Me"],"title_without_series":["Between the World and Me"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027m/25489625.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027s/25489625.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"],"num_pages":["152"],"format":["Kindle Edition"],"edition_information":["First Edition"],"publisher":["Spiegel & Grau"],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["132116"],"description":["In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br /><br />Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<br /><br />Source: penguinrandomhouse.com"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1214964"],"name":["Ta-Nehisi Coates"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p5/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p2/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1214964.Ta_Nehisi_Coates"],"average_rating":["4.31"],"ratings_count":["174926"],"text_reviews_count":["20876"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44848425"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F-n-hb4HqoKqonNt8NpNkg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467098","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459415"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13586707","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1609450787"],"isbn13":["9781609450786"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8451","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.jcMTG3qOtIZ45fGkDLOV3Q"],"title":["My Brilliant Friend (The Neapolitan Novels #1)"],"title_without_series":["My Brilliant Friend"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947m/13586707.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947s/13586707.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend"],"num_pages":["331"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Europa Editions"],"publication_day":["25"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["114185"],"description":["The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples.

She allows no-one to set foot inside her house; she masks herself with a veil and is equally guarded about her personal life. And yet Emerence is revered as much as she is feared.

It is here that the lives of two women, with two mysteries, will converge.<br /><br />Nineteen-year-old Night Vale pawn shop owner Jackie Fierro is given a paper marked \"King City\" by a mysterious man in a tan jacket holding a deer skin suitcase. Everything about him and his paper unsettles her, especially the fact that she can't seem to get the paper to leave her hand, and that no one who meets this man can remember anything about him. Jackie is determined to uncover the mystery of King City and the man in the tan jacket before she herself unravels.<br /><br />Night Vale PTA treasurer Diane Crayton's son, Josh, is moody and also a shape shifter. And lately Diane's started to see her son's father everywhere she goes, looking the same as the day he left years earlier, when they were both teenagers. Josh, looking different every time Diane sees him, shows a stronger and stronger interest in his estranged father, leading to a disaster Diane can see coming, even as she is helpless to prevent it.<br /><br />Diane's search to reconnect with her son and Jackie's search for her former routine life collide as they find themselves coming back to two words: \"King City\".

There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.<br /><br />Considering himself \"a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,\" Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress \"so pure, she didn't know what starving people looked like.\" <br /><br />Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master's Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love.

Fans of Paula Hawkins’ <em>The Girl on the Train</em> will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic <em>Strangers on a Train</em> from the author of the acclaimed <em>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</em>—which the <em>Washington Post</em> said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”<br /><br />On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.<br /><br />But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .<br /><br />Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.<br /><br />Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7142445"],"name":["Peter  Swanson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p5/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p2/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7142445.Peter_Swanson"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["79460"],"text_reviews_count":["10501"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["41240456"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mjDL7a8lLd-InoC-l7XHhQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1049698698","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:03 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:04 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1352654128"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"16278318","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804137250"],"isbn13":["9780804137256"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9387","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.mppxwf1f6WLJySVmFqqfQQ"],"title":["Armada"],"title_without_series":["Armada"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428m/16278318.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428s/16278318.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown Publishing "],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.50"],"ratings_count":["74294"],"description":["Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming.

After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe.<br /><br />And then he sees the flying saucer.<br /><br />Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i>—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. <br /><br />No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it.<br /><br />It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero.

J. Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.<br /><br />We are not quite novels.<br /><br />We are not quite short stories.<br /><br />In the end, we are collected works.<br /><br />A. J. Fikry's life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died; his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history; and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Chief Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who's always felt kindly toward him; from Ismay, his sister-in-law, who is hell-bent on saving A.J. from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who persists in taking the ferry to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.'s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, he can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It's a small package, though large in weight—an unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn't take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J., for the determined sales rep Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light, for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.'s world.

Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in The Return of the King."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["656983"],"name":["J.R.R.

Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an \"other\" New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck's particular brand of naivete and chutzpah by his ability to a hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider's vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory. Joseph O'Neill's prose, in its conscientiousness and beauty, involves us utterly in the struggle for meaning that governs any single life."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["389474"],"name":["Joseph O'Neill"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p5/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p2/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/389474.Joseph_O_Neill"],"average_rating":["3.40"],"ratings_count":["19005"],"text_reviews_count":["2876"]}]}],"published":["2008"],"work":[{"id":["2639658"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ro7BmRbyQxkIEjIy5pz3Dw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373125","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:52 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:53 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999997"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6601090","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kUbmJ18tU2hujEY8DdIMbA"],"title":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"title_without_series":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333m/6601090.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333s/6601090.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6601090-the-beckham-experiment"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.95"],"ratings_count":["1930"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2886182"],"name":["Grant Wahl"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p5/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p2/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2886182.Grant_Wahl"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["2038"],"text_reviews_count":["128"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["6554311"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U2EhrsHrWP3IqA4FKiMJqw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373085","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:50 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:51 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999945"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6435088","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"93","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.wEN74oUw1SPLzLTy38r2Ig"],"title":["The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Alchemyst"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665m/6435088.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665s/6435088.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6435088-the-alchemyst"],"num_pages":["402"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Canadian Edition"],"publisher":["Delacorte Books for Young Readers"],"publication_day":["20"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.84"],"ratings_count":["122037"],"description":["He holds the secret that can end the world.<br /><br />The truth: Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on September 28, 1330.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["171"],"text_reviews_count":["31"]}]}],"published":["2009"],"work":[{"id":["7075790"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.t2hTwbpM0FO8v8EFznV0zA"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:20 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:34 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151998549"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"8147904","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"117","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lADnwkLmBvcjg5oIsCQBOw"],"title":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"title_without_series":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007m/8147904.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007s/8147904.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8147904-06-20-000-meilen-unter-dem-meer"],"num_pages":[""],"format":["Audiobook"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["EUROPA Logo!"],"publication_day":["10"],"publication_year":["2010"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.87"],"ratings_count":["160929"],"description":["Man schreibt das Jahr 1867.

The devil will do all he asks on Earth and seeks to grant him a moment in life so glorious that he will wish it to last forever. But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe’s great work, the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a rejuvenated life and winning the love of the beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire, and self-delusion, Faust heads inexorably toward an infernal destruction.<br /><br />The best translation of Faust available, this volume provides the original German text and its English counterpart on facing pages. Walter Kaufmann's translation conveys the poetic beauty and rhythm as well as the complex depth of Goethe's language.

A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. <br /><br />He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. <br /><br />At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions.

What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. <br /><br />Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. <br /><br /><b>You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.</b><br /><br />This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit.

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.<br /><br />Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the enecplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />--jacket flap"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["585"],"name":["John Steinbeck"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["3128706"],"text_reviews_count":["85140"]}]}],"published":["2002"],"work":[{"id":["2574991"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.vt9gftgAURa2UyAzsYRzkw"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Apr 06 21:31:28 -0700 2015"],"read_at":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Tue Nov 11 19:04:51 -0800 2014"],"date_updated":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090950575"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2932","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375757325"],"isbn13":["9780375757327"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3510","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ZhW-W1AgOMy8jJLwQT3ofQ"],"title":["Robinson Crusoe"],"title_without_series":["Robinson Crusoe"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114m/2932.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114s/2932.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2932.Robinson_Crusoe"],"num_pages":["320"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Modern Library"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2001"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.66"],"ratings_count":["211825"],"description":["Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name \"Kreutznaer\") sets sail from the Queen's Dock in Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who want him to pursue a career, possibly in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his lust for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Sale pirates (the Sale Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation. Robinson Crusoe is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25 April 1719. This first edition credited the work's fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents.

Through an understanding of our design tools and how they relate to the web as a medium, we can empower ourselves to use type in meaningful and powerful ways.<br /><br /><i>This book will be released Summer 2012.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5819883"],"name":["Jason Santa Maria"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5819883.Jason_Santa_Maria"],"average_rating":["4.23"],"ratings_count":["372"],"text_reviews_count":["36"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["19204557"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.dJXsXzl28EuDCaNN5kI4Cg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"819502912","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Oct 27 19:37:06 -0700 2014"],"date_updated":["Mon Oct 27 19:37:07 -0700 2014"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949588"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949588"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090949415"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2549408","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0387245448"],"isbn13":["9780387245447"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"5","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.WJcBvOObrZmFEZsBZZN3Gw"],"title":["The Grammar of Graphics"],"title_without_series":["The Grammar of Graphics"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics"],"num_pages":["691"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Springer"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.20"],"ratings_count":["59"],"description":["Preface to First Edition Before writing the graphics for SYSTAT in the 1980's, I began by teaching a seminar in statistical graphics and collecting as many different quantitative graphics as I could find. I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a megabyte."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1127821"],"name":["Leland Wilkinson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1127821.Leland_Wilkinson"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["60"],"text_reviews_count":["5"]}]}],"published":["2005"],"work":[{"id":["2556993"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.x2EBm3lHD3LaP9Ekpee2tg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"819502748","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"date_updated":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090948872"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13497818","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316228532"],"isbn13":["9780316228534"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"26267","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TK5noI1A9syGxzSebYW9xQ"],"title":["The Casual Vacancy"],"title_without_series":["The Casual Vacancy"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913m/13497818.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913s/13497818.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497818-the-casual-vacancy"],"num_pages":["503"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["First Edition (US)"],"publisher":["Little, Brown and Company"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.29"],"ratings_count":["269907"],"description":["<b>A BIG NOVEL ABOUT A SMALL TOWN ...</b><br /><br />When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.<br /><br />Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty façade is a town at war.<br /><br />Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ...

Can our world support that? What kind of world will it be? Those answering these questions generally fall into two deeply divided groups--Wizards and Prophets, as Charles Mann calls them in this balanced, authoritative, nonpolemical new book. The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. <i>Cut back</i>! was his mantra. <i>Otherwise everyone will lose</i>! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. <i>Innovate</i>! was Borlaug's cry. <i>Only in that way can everyone win</i>! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <em>Norse Mythology</em>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of giants, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman’s deft and witty prose emerges the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to dupe others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B01HQA6EOC <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39673345-norse-mythology\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4810155"],"text_reviews_count":["282051"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["51396954"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZjetaSgZLpRuwbsCvexmjg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1949850409","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"date_updated":["Wed Feb 21 00:05:34 -0800 2018"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2303344972"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2277996853"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"34146863","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1943888108"],"isbn13":["9781943888108"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5Iu0dxorgFKOSw0F37NV_A"],"title":["Mammother"],"title_without_series":["Mammother"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165m/34146863.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492936165s/34146863.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34146863-mammother"],"num_pages":["328"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Featherproof Books"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2017"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["50"],"description":["The people of Pie Time are suffering from God's Finger, a mysterious plague that leaves its victims dead with a big hole through their chests.

At the heart of the story are Sam Finster, a senior in high school mourning the death of his mother, and his sister Trina, a nine-year-old deaf girl who denies her grief by dreaming of a nuclear apocalypse as Cold War tensions rise. Meanwhile, Sheriff Dave Dobbs and officer Nick Hayslip must try to put their own sorrows aside to figure out who, or what, is wreaking havoc on their once-idyllic town. <br /><br />Keith Rosson paints outside the typical genre lines with his brilliant debut novel.

Huck, abandoned and “dreadful lonely,” hires himself out to “whosoever.” He rides shotgun on coaches, wrangles horses on a Chisholm Trail cattle drive, joins a gang of bandits, guides wagon trains, gets dragged into U.S. Army massacres, and suffers a series of romantic and barroom misadventures.<br /><br />He is eventually drawn into a Lakota tribe by a young brave, Eeteh, an inventive teller of Coyote tales who “was having about the same kind of trouble with his tribe as I was having with mine.” There is an army colonel who wants to hang Huck and destroy Eeteh’s tribe, so they’re both on the run, finding themselves ultimately in the Black Hills just ahead of the 1876 Gold Rush.<br /><br />This period, from the middle of the Civil War to the centennial year of 1876, is probably the most formative era of the nation’s history. In the West, it is a time of grand adventure, but also one of greed, religious insanity, mass slaughter, virulent hatreds, widespread poverty and ignorance, ruthless military and civilian leadership, huge disparities of wealth.

Meanwhile, her husband's decade-long dedication to his invention, the causality violation device (which he would greatly prefer you not call a “time machine”) has effectively stalled his career and made him a laughingstock in the physics community.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student \"possessed,\" as he wrote, \"by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. <br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. <br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \"I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\" he wrote. \"Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'\" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["14031444"],"name":["Paul Kalanithi"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p5/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p2/14031444.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14031444.Paul_Kalanithi"],"average_rating":["4.33"],"ratings_count":["240784"],"text_reviews_count":["21833"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45424659"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oip55amienPK71A-wDcRGg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1715512408","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:23 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Sun Jul 16 11:13:24 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2062176919"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["2010516934"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"28094574","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"512","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kGP1I1c7HpCBdduAyT6bXA"],"title":["It"],"title_without_series":["It"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28094574-it"],"num_pages":["1169"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["586399"],"description":["Welcome to Derry, Maine.

Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.<br /><br />At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.<br /><br />Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.<br /><br />Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.<br /><br />Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["33919"],"name":["Jeff VanderMeer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p5/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1522640540p2/33919.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33919.Jeff_VanderMeer"],"average_rating":["3.68"],"ratings_count":["222079"],"text_reviews_count":["27111"]}]}],"published":["2017"],"work":[{"id":["48253660"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.plCUzpp1YC5oeLO-juikmg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1665142399","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"date_updated":["Thu May 25 20:17:04 -0700 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2010516277"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1971644292"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"12591698","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1841499900"],"isbn13":["9781841499901"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3138","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.0XisucKtvM8-4g28MVMe8A"],"title":["Caliban's War (The Expanse, #2)"],"title_without_series":["Caliban's War"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377m/12591698.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407572377s/12591698.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12591698-caliban-s-war"],"num_pages":["595"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Orbit (Hachette)"],"publication_day":["26"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.30"],"ratings_count":["61969"],"description":["We are not alone.<br /><br />On Ganymede, breadbasket of the outer planets, a Martian marine watches as her platoon is slaughtered by a monstrous supersoldier.

Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.<br /><br />Spanning five decades, <em>Commonwealth</em> explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the strange and genuine affection that grows up between them.<br /><br />When, in her twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book, ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt, and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another.<br /><br />Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, <em>Commonwealth</em> is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7136914"],"name":["Ann Patchett"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p5/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p2/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7136914.Ann_Patchett"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["611872"],"text_reviews_count":["56546"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["48242398"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.58k-i-dIBqduZVxInJS1pg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1565495783","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu Feb 09 23:12:16 -0800 2017"],"date_updated":["Thu Feb 09 23:12:17 -0800 2017"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1908757558"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1908757558"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1908755597"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"20518872","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0765377063"],"isbn13":["9780765377067"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6389","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.oUcAcIZioskWIAd_9N2ijQ"],"title":["The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Three-Body Problem"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415428227m/20518872.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415428227s/20518872.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem"],"num_pages":["400"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Tor Books"],"publication_day":["11"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["11"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["65807"],"description":["<i>The Three-Body Problem</i> is the first chance for English-speaking readers to experience this multiple award winning phenomenon from China's most beloved science fiction author, Liu Cixin.<br /><br />\"Fans of hard SF will revel in this intricate and imaginative novel by one of China’s most celebrated genre writers. In 1967, physics professor Ye Zhetai is killed after he refuses to denounce the theory of relativity. His daughter, Ye Wenjie, witnesses his gruesome death.<br /><br />\"Shortly after, she’s falsely charged with sedition for promoting the works of environmentalist Rachel Carson, and told she can avoid punishment by working at a defense research facility involved with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. More than 40 years later, Ye’s work becomes linked to a string of physicist suicides and a complex role-playing game involving the classic physics problem of the title.<br /><br />\"Liu impressively succeeds in integrating complex topics—such as the field of frontier science, which attempts to define the limits of science’s ability to know nature—without slowing down the action or sacrificing characterization. His smooth handling of the disparate plot elements cleverly sets up the second volume of the trilogy.\" —<i>Publishers Weekly</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5780686"],"name":["Liu Cixin"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454974329p5/5780686.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1454974329p2/5780686.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5780686.Liu_Cixin"],"average_rating":["4.19"],"ratings_count":["115460"],"text_reviews_count":["13471"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["25696480"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.3ezq41wkfaIOBo8GqTGV6Q"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 -0800 2017"],"read_at":["Tue Feb 28 21:41:00 -0800 2017"],"date_added":["Thu Feb 09 23:08:18 -0800 2017"],"date_updated":["Tue Feb 28 21:41:01 -0800 2017"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1908755597"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1908755597"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1861701900"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"7244","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0060786507"],"isbn13":["9780060786502"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"18572","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ahkbeUyO_3Np1VEqV8gCUw"],"title":["The Poisonwood Bible"],"title_without_series":["The Poisonwood Bible"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412242487m/7244.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412242487s/7244.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7244.The_Poisonwood_Bible"],"num_pages":["546"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Harper Perennial Modern Classics"],"publication_day":["5"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["587881"],"description":["<i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959.

The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life. I was ten years old.”<br /><br />Master storyteller Madeleine Thien takes us inside an extended family in China, showing us the lives of two successive generations—those who lived through Mao’s Cultural Revolution and their children, who became the students protesting in Tiananmen Square. At the center of this epic story are two young women, Marie and Ai-Ming. Through their relationship Marie strives to piece together the tale of her fractured family in present-day Vancouver, seeking answers in the fragile layers of their collective story. Her quest will unveil how Kai, her enigmatic father, a talented pianist, and Ai-Ming’s father, the shy and brilliant composer, Sparrow, along with the violin prodigy Zhuli were forced to reimagine their artistic and private selves during China’s political campaigns and how their fates reverberate through the years with lasting consequences.<br /><br />With maturity and sophistication, humor and beauty, Thien has crafted a novel that is at once intimate and grandly political, rooted in the details of life inside China yet transcendent in its universality."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["265535"],"name":["Madeleine Thien"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p5/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451969480p2/265535.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/265535.Madeleine_Thien"],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["13394"],"text_reviews_count":["2168"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["47869112"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1OOYQ0w6YUe93bciWWw9aQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1504037013","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:39 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Dec 18 11:02:40 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1842918454"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1839709882"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"11566","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0451933028"],"isbn13":["9780451933027"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3817","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.sUre5ipqFqF26Shanfil-A"],"title":["The Green Mile"],"title_without_series":["The Green Mile"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563m/11566.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373903563s/11566.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11566.The_Green_Mile"],"num_pages":["592"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Six Volume Box Set "],"publisher":["Penguin Signet"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["1996"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["4.43"],"ratings_count":["206385"],"description":["When it first appeared, one volume per month, Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE was an unprecedented publishing triumph: all six volumes ended up on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller lists—simultaneously—and delighted millions of fans the world over.<br /><br />Welcome to Cold Mountain Penitentiary, home to the Depression-worn men of E Block.

The next morning the snow child is gone - but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. <br /><br />This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness.

Instead, they are taught to persuade. Here the art of coercion has been raised to a science. Students harness the hidden power of language to manipulate the mind and learn to break down individuals by psychographic markers in order to take control of their thoughts. The very best will graduate as \"poets\", adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.<br /><br />Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams, where, once admitted, she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization, nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated. Emily becomes the school's most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake: She falls in love.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom. Although he has no recollection of anything they claim he's done, it turns out Wil is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets and is quickly caught in their increasingly deadly crossfire. Pursued relentlessly by people with powers he can barely comprehend and protected by the very man who first attacked him, Wil discovers that everything he thought he knew about his past was fiction. In order to survive, must journey to the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia, to discover who he is and why an entire town was blown off the map.<br /><br />As the two narratives converge, the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed, the body count rises, and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy, identity, and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion, <i>Lexicon</i> is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["18741"],"name":["Max Barry"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p5/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310004110p2/18741.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18741.Max_Barry"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["52704"],"text_reviews_count":["6071"]}]}],"published":["2013"],"work":[{"id":["20077336"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U1mmjxA6FhnAztz2O0MmQQ"]}]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:53 -0800 2016"],"read_at":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:13 -0800 2016"],"date_added":["Wed Dec 07 22:46:52 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 12 20:10:14 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1833323852"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1817580706"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23590496","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0857522973"],"isbn13":["9780857522979"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"804","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4OHq6Ghbd-Nq84nG8un-tQ"],"title":["Fortune Smiles"],"title_without_series":["Fortune Smiles"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824m/23590496.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1446423824s/23590496.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23590496-fortune-smiles"],"num_pages":["304"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Doubleday"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["7732"],"description":["Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his acclaimed and bestselling novel The Orphan Master's Son, Adam Johnson is one of America's most provocative and powerful authors.

In \"Hurricanes Anonymous\" - first included in the Best American Short Stories anthology - a young man searches for the mother of his son in a Louisiana devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.<p>A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.</p><p>Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, <em>In the Garden of Beasts</em> lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity.

They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come.

Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point. <br /><br />Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.<br /><br />And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.<br /><br />Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is.

Fronted by his pasty, vampiric manager, Edgar Falk, Bruno arrives in Berlin after a troubling run of bad luck in Singapore. Perhaps it was the chance encounter with his crass childhood acquaintance Keith Stolarsky and his smoldering girlfriend Tira Harpaz. Or perhaps it was the emergence of a blot that distorts his vision so he has to look at the board sideways.<br /><br />Things don't go much better in Berlin. Bruno's flirtation with Madchen, the striking blonde he meets on the ferry, is inconclusive; the game at the unsettling Herr Kohler's mansion goes awry as his blot grows worse; he passes out and is sent to the local hospital, where he is given an extremely depressing diagnosis. Having run through Falk's money, Bruno turns to Stolarsky, who, for reasons of his own, agrees to fly Bruno to Berkeley, and to pay for the experimental surgery that might save his life.<br /><br />Berkeley, where Bruno discovered his psychic abilities, and to which he vowed never to return. Amidst the patchouli flashbacks and Anarchist gambits of the local scene, between Tira's come-ons and Keith's machinations, Bruno confronts two existential questions: Is the gambler being played by life?

An experienced falconer—Helen had been captivated by hawks since childhood—she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself \"in the hawk's wild mind to tame her\" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life. <br /><br />Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry.

Life is hellish for all the slaves but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood - where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned and, though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br /><br />In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor - engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven - but the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. Even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br /><br />As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <em>The Underground Railroad</em> is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["10029"],"name":["Colson Whitehead"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p5/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399317975p2/10029.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10029.Colson_Whitehead"],"average_rating":["3.92"],"ratings_count":["187539"],"text_reviews_count":["21907"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["48287641"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.w3i1MZHRKRjFbrU4wJf2TA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1396406479","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:34 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981895"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1729981675"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18693910","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1594203474"],"isbn13":["9781594203473"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1036","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OYgHo_97kTmGbedB1chEww"],"title":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"title_without_series":["Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620m/18693910.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418768620s/18693910.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693910-barbarian-days"],"num_pages":["447"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Penguin Press"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["10183"],"description":["<b>A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed<i> New Yorker </i>writer</b><br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days</i> is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.<br /><br />Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.<br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days </i>is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7378"],"name":["William Finnegan"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7378.William_Finnegan"],"average_rating":["4.18"],"ratings_count":["10592"],"text_reviews_count":["1267"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["26542461"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IKvs1evjU9M-r1exWf115Q"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1396406234","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:16 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Aug 16 07:34:16 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981675"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729981675"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1726804035"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"11084145","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1451648537"],"isbn13":["9781451648539"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"14772","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.55oEh7mAhPW_FkeSWIhWPQ"],"title":["Steve Jobs"],"title_without_series":["Steve Jobs"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511288482m/11084145.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1511288482s/11084145.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"],"num_pages":["656"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Simon & Schuster"],"publication_day":["24"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["4.11"],"ratings_count":["701861"],"description":["From best-selling author Walter Isaacson comes the landmark biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.<br /><br />In <i>Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography</i>, Isaacson provides an extraordinary account of Jobs' professional and personal life.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.<br /><br />During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4039811"],"name":["Veronica Roth"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p5/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363910238p2/4039811.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4039811.Veronica_Roth"],"average_rating":["4.08"],"ratings_count":["4611512"],"text_reviews_count":["256668"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["13155899"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rBaAZasQyoeUWDUqmXfzJA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1389783005","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:32 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Aug 08 20:15:33 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1723045762"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1715633153"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"5659","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0143039091"],"isbn13":["9780143039099"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2969","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Y6Tj1XDUHYcT9fle4yewtg"],"title":["The Wind in the Willows"],"title_without_series":["The Wind in the Willows"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570m/5659.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423183570s/5659.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5659.The_Wind_in_the_Willows"],"num_pages":["256"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Penguin Classics"],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["153047"],"description":["<i>One of the most celebrated works of classic literature for children</i><br /><br />Meet little Mole, willful Ratty, Badger the perennial bachelor, and petulant Toad.

Here is the kaleidoscopic story of the quintessential American murder--one young black man slaying another--and a determined crew of detectives whose creed was to pursue justice at all costs for its forgotten victims. <i>Ghettoside</i> is a fast-paced narrative of a devastating crime, an intimate portrait of detectives and a community bonded in tragedy, and a surprising new lens into the great subject of murder in America--why it happens and how the plague of killings might yet be stopped."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5365282"],"name":["Jill Leovy"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_200x266-3061b784cc8e7f021c6430c9aba94587.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_50x66-6a03a5c12233c941481992b82eea8d23.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5365282.Jill_Leovy"],"average_rating":["4.12"],"ratings_count":["12272"],"text_reviews_count":["1613"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["18331880"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.t-O0NzifkEa3rrWeqcAItg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1362345721","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jul 10 08:56:36 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Jul 10 08:56:37 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1693814228"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1693814228"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1689752693"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"85697","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0142001104"],"isbn13":["9780142001103"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"550","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.jCpDgjlOTPfOsRN_55bxjA"],"title":["The Art of Possibility"],"title_without_series":["The Art of Possibility"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327178963m/85697.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327178963s/85697.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85697.The_Art_of_Possibility"],"num_pages":["210"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Penguin"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2006"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.05"],"ratings_count":["5340"],"description":["Presenting twelve breakthrough practices for bringing creativity into all human endeavors, The Art of Possibility is the dynamic product of an extraordinary partnership.

His groundbreaking research exposes ten well-disguised mental Saboteurs. Nearly 95 percent of the executives in his Stanford lectures conclude that these Saboteurs cause “significant harm” to achieving their true potential. With Positive Intelligence, you can learn the secret to defeating these internal foes. Positive Intelligence (PQ)SM measures the percentage of time your mind is serving you as opposed to sabotaging you. While your IQ and EQ (emotional intelligence) contribute to your maximum potential, it is your PQ that determines how much of that potential you actually achieve.<br /><br />The great news is that you can improve your PQ significantly in as little as 21 days. With higher PQ, teams and professionals ranging from leaders to salespeople perform 30 to 35 percent better on average. Importantly, they also report being far happier and less stressed. The breakthrough tools and techniques in this book have been refined over years of coaching hundreds of CEOs and their executive teams. Shirzad tells many of their remarkable stories, showing how you too can take concrete steps to unleash the vast, untapped powers of your mind.<br /><br />Discover how to<br />•    Identify and conquer your top Saboteurs. Common Saboteurs include the Judge, Controller, Victim, Avoider, and Pleaser.  <br />•    Measure the Positive Intelligence score (PQ) for yourself or your team—and see how close you come to the critical tipping point required for peak performance.<br />•    Increase PQ dramatically in as little as 21 days.<br />•    Develop new brain “muscles,” and access 5 untapped powers with energizing mental “power games.”<br />•    Apply PQ tools and techniques to increase both performance and fulfillment. Applications include team building, mastering workload, working with “difficult” people, improving work/life balance, reducing stress, and selling and persuading.<br /><br /><br />"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5385616"],"name":["Shirzad Chamine"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5385616.Shirzad_Chamine"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["1023"],"text_reviews_count":["104"]}]}],"published":["2012"],"work":[{"id":["18408206"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.OvI8U2YrP9vBMwQxj8P3_g"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1358567684","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Wed Jul 06 07:57:36 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Wed Jul 06 07:57:37 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1689752422"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1689752422"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1688659496"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23275060","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"17","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.APosD2hzCWGHNp5ysMKQ6A"],"title":["15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership"],"title_without_series":["15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514533011m/23275060.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514533011s/23275060.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23275060-15-commitments-of-conscious-leadership"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.21"],"ratings_count":["333"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["701885"],"name":["Jim Dethmer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/701885.Jim_Dethmer"],"average_rating":["4.20"],"ratings_count":["336"],"text_reviews_count":["25"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["42814378"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.j1Ctgci5l3Z4EjQpUaI7lA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1357543091","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Jul 05 08:02:48 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Tue Jul 05 08:02:48 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1688659496"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1688659496"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1688658900"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"923950","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0553062182"],"isbn13":["9780553062182"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"888","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.R6RiOgmAjOxYMS2wCOstCA"],"title":["The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You"],"title_without_series":["The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320525063m/923950.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320525063s/923950.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/923950.The_Highly_Sensitive_Person"],"num_pages":["251"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Harmony"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["1997"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.88"],"ratings_count":["23137"],"description":["Do you have a keen imagination and vivid dreams?

Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In \"Adventure Story\"--a thematic companion to <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, <i>Trigger Warning</i> is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1221698"],"name":["Neil Gaiman"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman"],"average_rating":["4.13"],"ratings_count":["4810155"],"text_reviews_count":["282051"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["41947380"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.O36fhUH9r75FYraiRsLzFA"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016"],"read_at":["Fri Sep 02 00:00:00 -0700 2016"],"date_added":["Mon Jun 06 13:01:46 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Fri Sep 02 21:24:59 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660850824"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660850824"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1660849716"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"25980294","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"148","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.HkDnRYcQvCG-KmNbswjERg"],"title":["Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"],"title_without_series":["Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25980294-deep-work"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.19"],"ratings_count":["27860"],"description":["<b>One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b><br /><br />Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.<br /><br />In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules,\" for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.<br /><br />A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["147891"],"name":["Cal Newport"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p5/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1347995468p2/147891.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["47953"],"text_reviews_count":["4676"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["45502249"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.k9-gUtwNW3ArJP-Nse69yA"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152513","name":"currently-reading","review_shelf_id":"1331089696","sortable":"false"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:39 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon Jun 06 13:00:40 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1660849716"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1651336590"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"27209486","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["159463467X"],"isbn13":["9781594634673"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"2433","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.EwzMmV6qSEHWJhKSJwzgtA"],"title":["Modern Lovers"],"title_without_series":["Modern Lovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735m/27209486.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458657735s/27209486.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27209486-modern-lovers"],"num_pages":["353"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Riverhead Books"],"publication_day":["31"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.44"],"ratings_count":["29468"],"description":["<b>From the <i>New York Times</i>‒bestselling author of <i>The Vacationers</i>, a smart, highly entertaining novel about a tight-knit group of friends from college—their own kids now going to college—and what it means to finally grow up well after adulthood has set in.</b><br /><br />Friends and former college bandmates Elizabeth and Andrew and Zoe have watched one another marry, buy real estate, and start businesses and families, all while trying to hold on to the identities of their youth.

Taught as a girl to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village, Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for another woman.

At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged—a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl’s life when everything can go horribly wrong."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2926065"],"name":["Emma Cline"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p5/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448177198p2/2926065.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2926065.Emma_Cline"],"average_rating":["3.48"],"ratings_count":["124555"],"text_reviews_count":["13972"]}]}],"published":["2016"],"work":[{"id":["42856015"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.a02kG7jJEMIckrwBpO7ssQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1322174044","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat May 28 09:17:25 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Sat May 28 09:17:26 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1651334619"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1646668577"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"23692271","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9654","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.4aaEOknMj7166lgef5EmXw"],"title":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"title_without_series":["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954m/23692271.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420585954s/23692271.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"],"num_pages":["443"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Harvill Secker"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.45"],"ratings_count":["140053"],"description":["100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. <br /><br />How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? <br /><br />In <i>Sapiens</i>, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? <br /><br />Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["395812"],"name":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p5/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505974966p2/395812.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/395812.Yuval_Noah_Harari"],"average_rating":["4.42"],"ratings_count":["183701"],"text_reviews_count":["16585"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["18962767"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.wrue7885k_mhTCRSy0O0VQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1317781208","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon May 23 11:17:59 -0700 2016"],"date_updated":["Mon May 23 11:18:00 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1646668577"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1644942608"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"1735330","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0340937688"],"isbn13":["9780340937686"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"517","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.W2m2Hmo_IEoo4GgfR2nBjA"],"title":["The Night Manager"],"title_without_series":["The Night Manager"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1735330.The_Night_Manager"],"num_pages":["597"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Sceptre"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2006"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.81"],"ratings_count":["10863"],"description":["In the shadowy recesses of Whitehall and Washington an unholy alliance operates between the intelligence community and the secret arms trade.

No one has insight into their true character like the people who serve their meals and make their beds every day. Full of stories and details by turns dramatic, humorous, and heartwarming, <em>The Residence</em> reveals daily life in the White House as it is really lived through the voices of the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others who tend to the needs of the President and First Family.<br /><br />These dedicated professionals maintain the six-floor mansion’s 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, 28 fireplaces, three elevators, and eight staircases, and prepare everything from hors d’oeuvres for intimate gatherings to meals served at elaborate state dinners. Over the course of the day, they gather in the lower level’s basement kitchen to share stories, trade secrets, forge lifelong friendships, and sometimes even fall in love.<br /><br />Combining incredible first-person anecdotes from extensive interviews with scores of White House staff members—many speaking for the first time—with archival research, Kate Andersen Brower tells their story. She reveals the intimacy between the First Family and the people who serve them, as well as tension that has shaken the staff over the decades. From the housekeeper and engineer who fell in love while serving President Reagan to Jackie Kennedy’s private moment of grief with a beloved staffer after her husband’s assassination to the tumultuous days surrounding President Nixon’s resignation and President Clinton’s impeachment battle, <em>The Residence</em> is full of surprising and moving details that illuminate day-to-day life at the White House."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["8378127"],"name":["Kate Andersen Brower"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1487990412p5/8378127.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1487990412p2/8378127.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8378127.Kate_Andersen_Brower"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["18859"],"text_reviews_count":["2597"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["42205784"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DbuIEYrfCGGSmIrpuAtLzg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1176713459","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Jan 03 16:04:06 -0800 2016"],"date_updated":["Sun Jan 03 16:04:07 -0800 2016"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1493728804"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1493728804"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1493727166"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"16160797","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316206849"],"isbn13":["9780316206846"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"23910","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YaeOqX02QVR6ZNerJt51KQ"],"title":["The Cuckoo's Calling (Cormoran Strike, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Cuckoo's Calling"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358716559m/16160797.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358716559s/16160797.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling"],"num_pages":["455"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Mulholland Books / Little, Brown and Company"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["384808"],"description":["<i>The Cuckoo's Calling</i> is a 2013 crime fiction novel by J.

Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.<br /><br />Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.<br /><br />You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike.

The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: \"Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.\" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next. <p> The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches--stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition--with explorations of how and why we read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. <i>If on a Winter's Night</i> is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. \"What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.\"</p>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["155517"],"name":["Italo Calvino"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1501975461p5/155517.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1501975461p2/155517.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/155517.Italo_Calvino"],"average_rating":["4.04"],"ratings_count":["220409"],"text_reviews_count":["14818"]}]}],"published":["1982"],"work":[{"id":["1116802"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oqzEienp9YhlsREz7gon0w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1171699716","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Thu Dec 31 11:42:21 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Thu Dec 31 11:42:21 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1487592791"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1487592791"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1484514888"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2203053","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1602062110"],"isbn13":["9781602062115"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6U1ICCuWmvGVgRlDt4h6tA"],"title":["Your Forces and How to Use Them"],"title_without_series":["Your Forces and How to Use Them"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203053.Your_Forces_and_How_to_Use_Them"],"num_pages":["336"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Cosimo Classics"],"publication_day":["15"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["4.32"],"ratings_count":["109"],"description":["One often hears about the power of positive thinking, but rarely is a book so practical in teaching the reader how to refine such thought and use it as a foundation for achieving success.

And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.<br /><br />Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves. <br /><br />We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square. <br /><br />The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.<br /><br />But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures. <br /><br />Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do. <br /><br />The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["153503"],"name":["Sherry Turkle"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p5/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1351354712p2/153503.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/153503.Sherry_Turkle"],"average_rating":["3.71"],"ratings_count":["8093"],"text_reviews_count":["1201"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44223191"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MFGBmbtHc72-dDsDWN9I8w"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1168964054","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Tue Dec 29 07:34:26 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1484487718"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1484486982"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"15790842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316176486"],"isbn13":["9780316176484"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"19207","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Qk3OvOwJVbNXcvgz7J2rnA"],"title":["Life After Life (Todd Family, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Life After Life"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808m/15790842.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358173808s/15790842.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842-life-after-life"],"num_pages":["531"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Reagan Arthur Books"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["4"],"average_rating":["3.75"],"ratings_count":["169514"],"description":["What if you could live again and again, until you got it right? <br /><br />On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born to an English banker and his wife.

Though skilled at bookkeeping, she cannot find a job in the miserable Irish economy. When an Irish priest from Brooklyn offers to sponsor Eilis in America--to live and work in a Brooklyn neighborhood \"just like Ireland\"--she decides she must go, leaving her fragile mother and her charismatic sister behind.<br /><br />Eilis finds work in a department store on Fulton Street, and when she least expects it, finds love.

Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they naturally have known of each other for decades; in fact, Addie was quite fond of Louis's wife. His daughter lives hours away in Colorado Springs, her son even farther away in Grand Junction, and Addie and Louis have long been living alone in houses now empty of family, the nights so terribly lonely, especially with no one to talk with. <br /><br />Their brave adventures - their pleasures and their difficulties - are hugely involving and truly resonant, making Our Souls at Night the perfect final installment to this beloved writer's enduring contribution to American literature."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["16266"],"name":["Kent Haruf"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1309205400p5/16266.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1309205400p2/16266.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16266.Kent_Haruf"],"average_rating":["4.01"],"ratings_count":["134756"],"text_reviews_count":["16133"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["43166999"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.3bkmSR9QAZir0zGJBf2y_w"]}]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":["Mon Jul 18 00:00:00 -0700 2016"],"date_added":["Mon Dec 28 12:57:18 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Jul 18 21:09:16 -0700 2016"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1483426963"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1483426963"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1483424892"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"7743175","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0765325950"],"isbn13":["9780765325952"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4571","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.exS3BkSNFiG3bZF1yLjLDg"],"title":["A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time, #14)"],"title_without_series":["A Memory of Light"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336055749m/7743175.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336055749s/7743175.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7743175-a-memory-of-light"],"num_pages":["909"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["First"],"publisher":["Tor Books"],"publication_day":["8"],"publication_year":["2013"],"publication_month":["1"],"average_rating":["4.50"],"ratings_count":["86491"],"description":["Now in development for TV!<br /><br />Since 1990, when Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time® burst on the world with its first book, The Eye of the World, readers have been anticipating the final scenes of this extraordinary saga, which has sold over forty million copies in over thirty languages.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.

Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--\"Scout\"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past--a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision--a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to an American classic."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1825"],"name":["Harper Lee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p5/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1188820730p2/1825.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1825.Harper_Lee"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["3831573"],"text_reviews_count":["104365"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44458285"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rjDem32D95tDQK2yL0ZYrQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153935636","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:19 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 20:01:20 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467293674"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1467292667"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"10762469","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0312358342"],"isbn13":["9780312358341"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4796","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.t2RUtrEeIFuG-zIk-HMx2w"],"title":["The Leftovers"],"title_without_series":["The Leftovers"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433m/10762469.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404872433s/10762469.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10762469-the-leftovers"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["St. Martin's Press"],"publication_day":["30"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.39"],"ratings_count":["38941"],"description":["What if — whoosh, right now, with no explanation — a number of us simply vanished? Would some of us collapse? Would others of us go on, one foot in front of the other, as we did before the world turned upside down? That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened — not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children.<br /><br />Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet \"A\" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.<br /><br />With heart, intelligence and a rare ability to illuminate the struggles inherent in ordinary lives, Tom Perrotta has written a startling, thought-provoking novel about love, connection and loss."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["15907"],"name":["Tom Perrotta"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p5/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524093817p2/15907.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15907.Tom_Perrotta"],"average_rating":["3.47"],"ratings_count":["118602"],"text_reviews_count":["13845"]}]}],"published":["2011"],"work":[{"id":["15455523"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.LHzAfuicrOTT_Gh7GKyHBQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1153934693","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:43 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Sat Dec 12 19:59:44 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1467292667"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1465557640"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"24861842","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0393081087"],"isbn13":["9780393081084"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"260","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.y2fQb5Vvi4TmInN-Px8LoA"],"title":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"title_without_series":["The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science"],"image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861842-the-food-lab"],"num_pages":["960"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["W.

How to make homemade mac 'n' cheese that is as satisfyingly gooey and velvety-smooth as the blue box stuff, but far tastier? How to roast a succulent, moist turkey (forget about brining!)—and use a foolproof method that works every time?<br /><br />As Serious Eats's culinary nerd-in-residence, J. Kenji López-Alt has pondered all these questions and more. In <em>The Food Lab</em>, Kenji focuses on the science behind beloved American dishes, delving into the interactions between heat, energy, and molecules that create great food.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway’s governing Labour Party. In <i>The Island</i>, the journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become a terrorist?     <br /><br />As in her bestseller <i>The Bookseller of Kabul</i>, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik’s troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, and then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to “save Norway” from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik’s victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Utøya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country—famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["769979"],"name":["Åsne Seierstad"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p5/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1377897628p2/769979.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/769979._sne_Seierstad"],"average_rating":["3.86"],"ratings_count":["46573"],"text_reviews_count":["4082"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["26029348"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qJSqpFQCc5NlM7TWeT6fZQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149468112","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:32 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:28:33 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462460726"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459925"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"20758057","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375414142"],"isbn13":["9780375414145"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"258","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-WGbb3R_f2IDW6xP_eJVnw"],"title":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"title_without_series":["Empire of Cotton: A Global History"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945m/20758057.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400852945s/20758057.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20758057-empire-of-cotton"],"num_pages":["640"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Knopf"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["12"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1710"],"description":["The epic story of the rise and fall of the empire of cotton, its centrality to the world economy, and its making and remaking of global capitalism.<br /><br />Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert’s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.<br /><br />The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.<b>\n  <br /><br /></b>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["97917"],"name":["Sven Beckert"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/97917.Sven_Beckert"],"average_rating":["3.83"],"ratings_count":["1821"],"text_reviews_count":["324"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["40090517"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.W4svM3LChQzkOQNJQdyNYg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467355","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:23 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:27:30 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459925"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459637"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"25489625","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812993543"],"isbn13":["9780812993547"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"11432","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.pJoOfvwjyVRklvxPcmHPjA"],"title":["Between the World and Me"],"title_without_series":["Between the World and Me"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027m/25489625.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451435027s/25489625.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me"],"num_pages":["152"],"format":["Kindle Edition"],"edition_information":["First Edition"],"publisher":["Spiegel & Grau"],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["132116"],"description":["In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br /><br />Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.<br /><br />Source: penguinrandomhouse.com"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1214964"],"name":["Ta-Nehisi Coates"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p5/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1300129823p2/1214964.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1214964.Ta_Nehisi_Coates"],"average_rating":["4.31"],"ratings_count":["174926"],"text_reviews_count":["20876"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["44848425"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F-n-hb4HqoKqonNt8NpNkg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1149467098","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Mon Dec 07 08:26:57 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1462459637"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1462459415"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13586707","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1609450787"],"isbn13":["9781609450786"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8451","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.jcMTG3qOtIZ45fGkDLOV3Q"],"title":["My Brilliant Friend (The Neapolitan Novels #1)"],"title_without_series":["My Brilliant Friend"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947m/13586707.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343064947s/13586707.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend"],"num_pages":["331"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Europa Editions"],"publication_day":["25"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["114185"],"description":["The story begins in the 1950s, in a poor but vibrant neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples.

The housekeeper's reputation is one built on dependable efficiency, though she is something of an oddity. Stubborn, foul-mouthed and with a flagrant disregard for her employer's opinions she may even be crazy. She allows no-one to set foot inside her house; she masks herself with a veil and is equally guarded about her personal life. And yet Emerence is revered as much as she is feared. As the story progresses her energy and passion to help becomes clear, extinguishing any doubts arising out of her bizarre behaviour.

It is here that the lives of two women, with two mysteries, will converge.<br /><br />Nineteen-year-old Night Vale pawn shop owner Jackie Fierro is given a paper marked \"King City\" by a mysterious man in a tan jacket holding a deer skin suitcase. Everything about him and his paper unsettles her, especially the fact that she can't seem to get the paper to leave her hand, and that no one who meets this man can remember anything about him. Jackie is determined to uncover the mystery of King City and the man in the tan jacket before she herself unravels.<br /><br />Night Vale PTA treasurer Diane Crayton's son, Josh, is moody and also a shape shifter. And lately Diane's started to see her son's father everywhere she goes, looking the same as the day he left years earlier, when they were both teenagers. Josh, looking different every time Diane sees him, shows a stronger and stronger interest in his estranged father, leading to a disaster Diane can see coming, even as she is helpless to prevent it.<br /><br />Diane's search to reconnect with her son and Jackie's search for her former routine life collide as they find themselves coming back to two words: \"King City\".

There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor.

Fans of Paula Hawkins’ <em>The Girl on the Train</em> will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic <em>Strangers on a Train</em> from the author of the acclaimed <em>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</em>—which the <em>Washington Post</em> said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”<br /><br />On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.<br /><br />But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .<br /><br />Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.<br /><br />Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7142445"],"name":["Peter  Swanson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p5/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506083984p2/7142445.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7142445.Peter_Swanson"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["79460"],"text_reviews_count":["10501"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["41240456"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mjDL7a8lLd-InoC-l7XHhQ"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"1049698698","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:03 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Sun Aug 02 12:49:04 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352655072"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1352654128"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"16278318","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0804137250"],"isbn13":["9780804137256"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"9387","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.mppxwf1f6WLJySVmFqqfQQ"],"title":["Armada"],"title_without_series":["Armada"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428m/16278318.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377284428s/16278318.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada"],"num_pages":["355"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Crown Publishing "],"publication_day":["14"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["3.50"],"ratings_count":["74294"],"description":["Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure.<br /><br />But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe.<br /><br />And then he sees the flying saucer.<br /><br />Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i>—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. <br /><br />No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it.<br /><br />It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can’t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little…familiar?<br /><br />At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could, <i>Armada</i> is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make <i>Ready Player One</i> a phenomenon."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["31712"],"name":["Ernest Cline"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310753539p5/31712.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1310753539p2/31712.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31712.Ernest_Cline"],"average_rating":["4.20"],"ratings_count":["680709"],"text_reviews_count":["83859"]}]}],"published":["2015"],"work":[{"id":["22378124"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.LLVmdIlH4U3EDIlD_Cl5nQ"]}]}],"rating":["2"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Sun Aug 02 12:48:01 -0700 2015"],"read_at":["Sun Aug 02 21:39:45 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Sun Aug 02 12:48:01 -0700 2015"],"date_updated":["Sun Aug 02 21:39:45 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["3"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352654128"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1352654128"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1289635204"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"561699","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["057123397X"],"isbn13":["9780571233977"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"17","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.iW9vDWZ_iTWutoq9qJU8Sg"],"title":["Sunshine"],"title_without_series":["Sunshine"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501622688m/561699.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501622688s/561699.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/561699.Sunshine"],"num_pages":["160"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Farrar, Straus and Giroux"],"publication_day":["21"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.10"],"ratings_count":["273"],"description":["The Sun is dying, and mankind is dying with it.

J. Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.<br /><br />We are not quite novels.<br /><br />We are not quite short stories.<br /><br />In the end, we are collected works.<br /><br />A. J. Fikry's life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died; his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history; and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Chief Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who's always felt kindly toward him; from Ismay, his sister-in-law, who is hell-bent on saving A.J. from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who persists in taking the ferry to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.'s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, he can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It's a small package, though large in weight—an unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn't take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J., for the determined sales rep Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light, for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.'s world. Or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn't see coming."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["40593"],"name":["Gabrielle Zevin"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503541462p5/40593.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503541462p2/40593.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40593.Gabrielle_Zevin"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["284033"],"text_reviews_count":["36847"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["25694131"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.4sJPCdmnc-85Gty47vAN-A"]}]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":["Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Mon Feb 02 18:17:44 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Tue Mar 31 22:23:48 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["2"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1188961410"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1188961410"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1188957964"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"18143977","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1476746583"],"isbn13":["9781476746586"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"53510","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.0IooOCfVIQPcIMOpfSRpYA"],"title":["All the Light We Cannot See"],"title_without_series":["All the Light We Cannot See"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451445646m/18143977.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451445646s/18143977.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see"],"num_pages":["531"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Scribner"],"publication_day":["6"],"publication_year":["2014"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["4.32"],"ratings_count":["678671"],"description":["<b>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, a <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Top Ten Book, National Book Award finalist, more than two and a half years on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list</b><br /><br />From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the stunningly beautiful instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.<br /><br />Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works.

Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an \"other\" New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck's particular brand of naivete and chutzpah by his ability to a hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider's vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory. Joseph O'Neill's prose, in its conscientiousness and beauty, involves us utterly in the struggle for meaning that governs any single life."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["389474"],"name":["Joseph O'Neill"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p5/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1406117552p2/389474.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/389474.Joseph_O_Neill"],"average_rating":["3.40"],"ratings_count":["19005"],"text_reviews_count":["2876"]}]}],"published":["2008"],"work":[{"id":["2639658"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ro7BmRbyQxkIEjIy5pz3Dw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373125","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:52 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:53 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1152000065"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999997"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6601090","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kUbmJ18tU2hujEY8DdIMbA"],"title":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"title_without_series":["The Beckham Experiment: How the World's Most Famous Athlete Tried to Conquer America"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333m/6601090.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1255570333s/6601090.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6601090-the-beckham-experiment"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.95"],"ratings_count":["1930"],"description":[""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2886182"],"name":["Grant Wahl"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p5/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1503988375p2/2886182.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2886182.Grant_Wahl"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["2038"],"text_reviews_count":["128"]}]}],"published":[""],"work":[{"id":["6554311"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.U2EhrsHrWP3IqA4FKiMJqw"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"871373085","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:50 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:51 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151999997"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151999945"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6435088","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"93","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.wEN74oUw1SPLzLTy38r2Ig"],"title":["The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, #1)"],"title_without_series":["The Alchemyst"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665m/6435088.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328021665s/6435088.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6435088-the-alchemyst"],"num_pages":["402"],"format":[""],"edition_information":["Canadian Edition"],"publisher":["Delacorte Books for Young Readers"],"publication_day":["20"],"publication_year":["2007"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.84"],"ratings_count":["122037"],"description":["He holds the secret that can end the world.<br /><br />The truth: Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on September 28, 1330.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["171"],"text_reviews_count":["31"]}]}],"published":["2009"],"work":[{"id":["7075790"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.t2hTwbpM0FO8v8EFznV0zA"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:20 -0800 2015"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 02 13:49:34 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1151998971"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1151998549"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"8147904","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"117","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.lADnwkLmBvcjg5oIsCQBOw"],"title":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"title_without_series":["06/20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007m/8147904.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1529822007s/8147904.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8147904-06-20-000-meilen-unter-dem-meer"],"num_pages":[""],"format":["Audiobook"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["EUROPA Logo!"],"publication_day":["10"],"publication_year":["2010"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.87"],"ratings_count":["160929"],"description":["Man schreibt das Jahr 1867.

The devil will do all he asks on Earth and seeks to grant him a moment in life so glorious that he will wish it to last forever. But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe’s great work, the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a rejuvenated life and winning the love of the beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire, and self-delusion, Faust heads inexorably toward an infernal destruction.<br /><br />The best translation of Faust available, this volume provides the original German text and its English counterpart on facing pages. Walter Kaufmann's translation conveys the poetic beauty and rhythm as well as the complex depth of Goethe's language.

A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. <br /><br />He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. <br /><br />At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions.

In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. “<i>Mr. Mercedes</i> is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses” (<i>The Washington Post</i>).<br /><br />In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.<br /><br /> In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the “perk” and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.<br /><br /> Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady’s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.<br /><br /><i>Mr. Mercedes</i> is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3389"],"name":["Stephen King"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"],"average_rating":["4.02"],"ratings_count":["11461605"],"text_reviews_count":["405423"]}]}],"published":["2014"],"work":[{"id":["26680281"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.uz5CNiglQxAP79NXi1GB7g"]}]}],"rating":["2"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Fri Jan 02 13:44:51 -0800 2015"],"read_at":["Fri Jan 09 19:38:37 -0800 2015"],"date_added":["Wed Dec 24 09:27:06 -0800 2014"],"date_updated":["Fri Jan 09 20:16:50 -0800 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1140110480"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1140110480"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1107768621"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"8855321","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1841499889"],"isbn13":["9781841499888"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6561","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.5j4xED4lXoZAbxsPmZrz1w"],"title":["Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse, #1)"],"title_without_series":["Leviathan Wakes"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411013134m/8855321.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411013134s/8855321.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes"],"num_pages":["561"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Orbit"],"publication_day":["2"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["103901"],"description":["Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.<br /><br />Jim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt.

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.<br /><br />Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the enecplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />--jacket flap"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["585"],"name":["John Steinbeck"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"],"average_rating":["3.91"],"ratings_count":["3128706"],"text_reviews_count":["85140"]}]}],"published":["2002"],"work":[{"id":["2574991"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.vt9gftgAURa2UyAzsYRzkw"]}]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read","exclusive":"true","id":"5956498","review_shelf_id":""}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":["Mon Apr 06 21:31:28 -0700 2015"],"read_at":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"date_added":["Tue Nov 11 19:04:51 -0800 2014"],"date_updated":["Sun Jun 07 21:51:19 -0700 2015"],"read_count":["1"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1104022938"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090950575"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"2932","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375757325"],"isbn13":["9780375757327"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3510","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ZhW-W1AgOMy8jJLwQT3ofQ"],"title":["Robinson Crusoe"],"title_without_series":["Robinson Crusoe"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114m/2932.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403180114s/2932.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2932.Robinson_Crusoe"],"num_pages":["320"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Modern Library"],"publication_day":["12"],"publication_year":["2001"],"publication_month":["6"],"average_rating":["3.66"],"ratings_count":["211825"],"description":["Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name \"Kreutznaer\") sets sail from the Queen's Dock in Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who want him to pursue a career, possibly in law.

This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Sale pirates (the Sale Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation. Robinson Crusoe is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25 April 1719.

I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a megabyte."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1127821"],"name":["Leland Wilkinson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1127821.Leland_Wilkinson"],"average_rating":["4.22"],"ratings_count":["60"],"text_reviews_count":["5"]}]}],"published":["2005"],"work":[{"id":["2556993"],"uri":["kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.x2EBm3lHD3LaP9Ekpee2tg"]}]}],"rating":["0"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"exclusive":"true","id":"152512","name":"to-read","review_shelf_id":"819502748","sortable":"true"}}]}],"recommended_for":[""],"recommended_by":[""],"started_at":[""],"read_at":[""],"date_added":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"date_updated":["Mon Oct 27 19:36:53 -0700 2014"],"read_count":["0"],"body":["\n  "],"comments_count":["0"],"url":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1090949415"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["1090948872"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13497818","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0316228532"],"isbn13":["9780316228534"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"26267","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"uri":["kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TK5noI1A9syGxzSebYW9xQ"],"title":["The Casual Vacancy"],"title_without_series":["The Casual Vacancy"],"image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913m/13497818.jpg"],"small_image_url":["https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1509893913s/13497818.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497818-the-casual-vacancy"],"num_pages":["503"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["First Edition (US)"],"publisher":["Little, Brown and Company"],"publication_day":["27"],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":["9"],"average_rating":["3.29"],"ratings_count":["269907"],"description":["<b>A BIG NOVEL ABOUT A SMALL TOWN ...</b><br /><br />When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.<br /><br />Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty façade is a town at war.<br /><br />Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ...
