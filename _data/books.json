While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke... Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["3389"],"name":["Stephen King"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King"],"average_rating":["4.00"],"ratings_count":["9433534"],"text_reviews_count":["309924"]}]}],"published":["2011"]},{"id":[{"_":"10572","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0553381695"],"isbn13":["9780553381696"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"14298","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974m/10572.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358254974s/10572.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10572.A_Clash_of_Kings"],"num_pages":["761"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Bantam"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["4.40"],"ratings_count":["562224"],"description":["Alternate cover edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6041689-a-clash-of-kings\">here</a>. <br /><br /><br />Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. <br /><br />As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. <br /><br />A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. <br /><br />Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. <br /><br />Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment;a tale of pure excitement you will never forget."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["346732"],"name":["George R.R.

There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.<br /><br />This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations by H.

It is a time when publishing is still largely a private affair—a scattered family of small houses here and in Europe—a time of gatherings in fabled apartments and conversations that continue long into the night. In this world of dinners, deals, and literary careers, Bowman finds that he fits in perfectly. But despite his success, what eludes him is love. His first marriage goes bad, another fails to happen, and finally he meets a woman who enthralls him—before setting him on a course he could never have imagined for himself. <br /><br /> Romantic and haunting, <i>All That Is</i> explores a life unfolding in a world on the brink of change.

His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.<br /><br />Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.<br /><br />With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: <br /><blockquote> Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. </blockquote><br />Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, <i>Bel Canto</i> remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i>"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7136914"],"name":["Ann Patchett"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p5/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1371838720p2/7136914.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7136914.Ann_Patchett"],"average_rating":["3.85"],"ratings_count":["453772"],"text_reviews_count":["42755"]}]}],"published":["2005"]},{"id":[{"_":"43892","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0812551478"],"isbn13":["9780812551471"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"779","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Blood of the Fold (Sword of Truth, #3)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443563626m/43892.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1443563626s/43892.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43892.Blood_of_the_Fold"],"num_pages":["623"],"format":["Mass Market Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Tor Fantasy"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":["1997"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["61435"],"description":["<i>There is an alternate cover edition <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32334208-blood-of-the-fold\">here</a>.</i><br /><br />Richard comes to terms with his true identity as a War Wizard.

As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman &amp; Ada confront the vastly transformed world they’ve been delivered.<br /><br />Frazier reveals insight into human relations with the land &amp; the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great 19th century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. <i>Cold Mountain</i> recreates a world gone by that speaks to our time."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["7130"],"name":["Charles Frazier"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316568662p5/7130.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316568662p2/7130.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7130.Charles_Frazier"],"average_rating":["3.80"],"ratings_count":["199430"],"text_reviews_count":["7778"]}]}],"published":[""]},{"id":[{"_":"604803","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0765315238"],"isbn13":["9780765315236"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"728","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Confessor (Sword of Truth, #11)"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/604803.Confessor"],"num_pages":["603"],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["4.07"],"ratings_count":["38306"],"description":["<div>\n  <div>Descending into darkness, about to be overwhelmed by evil, those people still free are powerless to stop the coming dawn of a savage new world, while Richard faces the guilt of knowing that he must let it happen.

Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.<br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.<br /><br />A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star in the constellation of fantasy."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["38550"],"name":["Brandon Sanderson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p5/38550.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson"],"average_rating":["4.36"],"ratings_count":["1677808"],"text_reviews_count":["111920"]}]}],"published":["2006"]},{"id":[{"_":"10850969","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1455826995"],"isbn13":["9781455826995"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Elizabeth Street"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10850969-elizabeth-street"],"num_pages":[""],"format":["Audio CD"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Brilliance Audio"],"publication_day":["4"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.88"],"ratings_count":["11498"],"description":["“Basing her story on her own family narratives and a deep understanding of Italian Americans, [Fabiano] paints a vivid portrait not just of immigrants’ lives in the first ten years of the last century, but of the vicious criminals who preyed on them.” —Mike Dash, author of <i>The First Family</i><br /><br /><br /><br />In <i>Elizabeth Street</i>, Laurie Fabiano tells a remarkable, and previously unheard, story of the Italian immigrant experience at the start of the twentieth century. With stories culled from her own family history, Fabiano paints an entrancing portrait of Giovanna Costa, who, reeling from personal tragedies, tries to make a new life in a new world. Shot through with the smells and sights of Scilla, Italy, and New York’s burgeoning Little Italy, this intoxicating story follows Giovanna as she finds companionship, celebrates the birth of a baby girl, takes pride in a growing business, and feels a sense of belonging during a family outing to Coney Island.<br /><br /><br /><br />However, these modest successes are rewarded with the attention of the notorious Black Hand, a gang of brutal extortionists led by Lupo the Wolf. As the stakes grow higher, Giovanna desperately struggles to remain outside the fray, so she may fight for—and finally save—what is important above all else: family."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2976501"],"name":["Laurie Fabiano"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442502836p5/2976501.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442502836p2/2976501.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2976501.Laurie_Fabiano"],"average_rating":["3.88"],"ratings_count":["11498"],"text_reviews_count":["1172"]}]}],"published":["2011"]},{"id":[{"_":"6969","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0141439580"],"isbn13":["9780141439587"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"8068","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Emma"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373627931m/6969.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373627931s/6969.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6969.Emma"],"num_pages":["474"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Penguin Classics"],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["6"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["5"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["467062"],"description":["<i>'I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.'</i><br /><br />Beautiful, clever, rich - and single - Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage.

With rich characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, <b>Golden Fool</b> brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.<br /><br /><b>Golden Fool<br /><br /></b>Prince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible. Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock, bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly, Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.<br /><br />The problems are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets. Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread “beast magic.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process, they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous consequences for all.<br /><br />Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with the Fool brings him any solace.

The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters -- including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations -- engages in incomparably rich dialogue.

Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.<br /><br />A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.<br /><br />But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It's nothing you could have expected."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4763"],"name":["John Scalzi"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi"],"average_rating":["4.00"],"ratings_count":["404484"],"text_reviews_count":["32944"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"32581","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0679410430"],"isbn13":["9780679410430"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"231","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Lolita"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32581.Lolita"],"num_pages":["335"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Everyman's Library"],"publication_day":["9"],"publication_year":["1993"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["3.88"],"ratings_count":["485512"],"description":[" <br /><br />When it was published in 1955, <i>Lolita</i> immediately became a cause célèbre because of the freedom and sophistication with which it handled the unusual erotic predilections of its protagonist.

And now another voyager -- this time from the east -- has arrived, a pysician determined to make his mark amid the shifting, treachearous currents of passion and violence that will determine the empire's fate."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.10"],"ratings_count":["149639"],"text_reviews_count":["8890"]}]}],"published":["2001"]},{"id":[{"_":"7624","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0140283331"],"isbn13":["9780140283334"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"19324","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Lord of the Flies"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327869409m/7624.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327869409s/7624.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies"],"num_pages":["182"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":["Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century"],"publisher":["Penguin Books "],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["1999"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["3.63"],"ratings_count":["1548432"],"description":["When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors.

Now, the international bestselling and multiple award-winning author revisits that invented setting four centuries later with an epic of prideful emperors, battling courtiers, bandits and soldiers, nomadic invasions, and a woman battling in her own way, to find a new place for women in the world – a world inspired this time by the glittering, decadent Song Dynasty.<br /><br />Ren Daiyan was still just a boy when he took the lives of seven men while guarding an imperial magistrate of Kitai. That moment on a lonely road changed his life—in entirely unexpected ways, sending him into the forests of Kitai among the outlaws. From there he emerges years later—and his life changes again, dramatically, as he circles towards the court and emperor, while war approaches Kitai from the north.<br /><br />Lin Shan is the daughter of a scholar, his beloved only child. Educated by him in ways young women never are, gifted as a songwriter and calligrapher, she finds herself living a life suspended between two worlds. Her intelligence captivates an emperor—and alienates women at the court. But when her father’s life is endangered by the savage politics of the day, Shan must act in ways no woman ever has.<br /><br />In an empire divided by bitter factions circling an exquisitely cultured emperor who loves his gardens and his art far more than the burdens of governing, dramatic events on the northern steppe alter the balance of power in the world, leading to events no one could have foretold, under the river of stars."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.10"],"ratings_count":["149639"],"text_reviews_count":["8890"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"429084","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0521825466"],"isbn13":["9780521825467"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"6","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Romeo and Juliet"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429084.Romeo_and_Juliet"],"num_pages":["266"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Cambridge University Press"],"publication_day":["4"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.73"],"ratings_count":["1564078"],"description":["Blakemore Evans' performance history helps readers visualize the stage action of Romeo and Juliet and alerts them to difficulties in language, thought and staging.

For on San Piedro, memory grows as thickly as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries - memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from <i>Star Trek</i>: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.<br /><br />Spanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, <i>Station Eleven</i> tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2786093"],"name":["Emily St. John Mandel"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397057120p5/2786093.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1397057120p2/2786093.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2786093.Emily_St_John_Mandel"],"average_rating":["3.99"],"ratings_count":["168237"],"text_reviews_count":["22383"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"11084145","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1451648537"],"isbn13":["9781451648539"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"13399","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Steve Jobs"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327861368m/11084145.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327861368s/11084145.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"],"num_pages":["656"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Simon & Schuster"],"publication_day":["24"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["10"],"average_rating":["4.08"],"ratings_count":["477038"],"description":["From best-selling author Walter Isaacson comes the landmark biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.<br /><br />In <i>Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography</i>, Isaacson provides an extraordinary account of Jobs' professional and personal life.

The time has come to look for new ways to create friendly, livable spaces around our homes.<br /><br /> In <i>The American Meadow Garden</i>, ornamental grass expert John Greenlee creates a new model for homeowners and gardeners. For Greenlee, a meadow isn't a random assortment of messy, anonymous grasses. Rather, it is a shimmering mini-ecosystem, in which regionally appropriate grasses combine with colorful perennials to form a rich tapestry that is friendly to all life — with minimal input of water, time, and other scarce resources. Kids and pets can play in complete safety, and birds and butterflies flock there. A prairie style planting is a place you <i>want</i> to be.<br /><br /> With decades of experience as a nurseryman and designer, John Greenlee is the perfect guide. He details all the practicalities of site preparation, plant selection, and maintenance; particularly valuable are his explanations of how ornamental grasses perform in different climates and areas. Gorgeous photography by Saxon Holt visually illustrates the message with stunning examples of meadow gardens from across the country.<br /><br /> We've reached a stage where we can no longer follow past practices unthinkingly, particularly when those practices are wasteful and harmful to the environment. It's time to get rid of the old-fashioned lawn and embrace a sane and healthy future: the American meadow garden."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["468743"],"name":["John Greenlee"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","$":{"nophoto":"true"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/468743.John_Greenlee"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["140"],"text_reviews_count":["29"]}]}],"published":["2009"]},{"id":[{"_":"431274","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0439895294"],"isbn13":["9780439895293"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"256","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Arrival"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075m/431274.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288649075s/431274.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431274.The_Arrival"],"num_pages":["124"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Arthur A.

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart.

In the bootheel of New Mexico hard on the frontier, Billy and Boyd Parham are just boys in the years before the Second World War, but on the cusp of unimaginable events. First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought onto the plain by settlers - this when all the wisdom of trappers has disappeared along with the trappers themselves. So Billy sets forth at the age of sixteen on an unwitting journey into the souls of boys, animals and men.<br /><br />Having trapped a she-wolf he would restore to the mountains of Mexico, he is long gone and returns to find everything he left behind transformed utterly in his absence. Except his kid brother, Boyd, with whom he strikes out yet again to reclaim what is theirs - thus crossing into \"that antique gaze from whence there could be no way back forever.\"<br /><br />What they find instead, is an extraordinary panoply of fiestas and circuses, dogs, horses and hawks, pilgrims and revolutionaries, grand haciendas and forlorn cantinas, bandits, gypsies and roving tribes, a young girl alone on the road, a mystery in the mountain wilds, and a myth in the making.<br /><br />And in this wider world they fight a war as rageful as the one neither, in the end, will join up for back home. One brother finds his destiny, while the other arrives only at his fate.<br /><br />An essential novel by any measure, and the transfixing middle passage of Cormac McCarthy's ongoing trilogy, The Crossing is luminous and appalling, a book that touches, stops,and starts the heart and mind at once."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4178"],"name":["Cormac McCarthy"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1414695980p5/4178.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1414695980p2/4178.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4178.Cormac_McCarthy"],"average_rating":["3.99"],"ratings_count":["866507"],"text_reviews_count":["61916"]}]}],"published":["1994"]},{"id":[{"_":"259028","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0375725601"],"isbn13":["9780375725609"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"3710","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259028.The_Devil_in_the_White_City"],"num_pages":["447"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Vintage Books"],"publication_day":["10"],"publication_year":["2004"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["3.98"],"ratings_count":["323363"],"description":["Bringing Chicago circa 1893 to vivid life, Erik Larson's spell-binding bestseller intertwines the true tale of two men--the brilliant architect behind the legendary 1893 World's Fair, striving to secure America's place in the world; and the cunning serial killer who used the fair to lure his victims to their death.

The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents <i>The Gathering Storm</i> as the first of three novels that will make up <i>A Memory of Light.</i> This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.<br /><br />In this epic novel, Robert Jordan’s international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al’Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward—wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders—his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.<br /><br />Egwene al’Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower—and possibly the world itself.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["6252"],"name":["Robert Jordan"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1175475715p5/6252.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1175475715p2/6252.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6252.Robert_Jordan"],"average_rating":["4.15"],"ratings_count":["1634731"],"text_reviews_count":["36466"]}]}],"published":["2009"]},{"id":[{"_":"22557272","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1594633665"],"isbn13":["9781594633669"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"67382","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Girl on the Train"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1469460259m/22557272.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1469460259s/22557272.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train"],"num_pages":["336"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Riverhead Books"],"publication_day":["13"],"publication_year":["2015"],"publication_month":["1"],"average_rating":["3.87"],"ratings_count":["871444"],"description":["<b>The debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people's lives.</b><br /><br />EVERY DAY THE SAME<br />Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night.

However, it is his destiny to travel to the dwarflands in the east, to help slay the dragon Smaug. His quest takes him through enchanted forests, spiders' lairs, and under the Misty Mountains, where he comes across the vile Gollum, and tricks him out of his 'Precious' - a ring that makes its bearer invisible, and wields a terrible power of its own.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition:<br /><br />\"If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) - if you do not already know all about these things - much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period.\"<br /><br />\"For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

Under his tutelage, Locke grows to lead the Bastards, delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another. Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr, and no wealthy noble is safe from his sting.<br /><br />Passing themselves off as petty thieves, the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of light-fingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworld's most feared ruler, Capa Barsavi.

In American colleges, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. As Madeleine studies the age-old motivations of the human heart, real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead - charismatic loner and college Darwinist - suddenly turns up in a seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old friend Mitchell Grammaticus - who’s been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange - resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.<br /><br />Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they have learned. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology laboratory on Cape Cod, but can’t escape the secret responsible for Leonard’s seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love.<br /><br />Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce?

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, carving a place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men-complicating his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized or fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belong-a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny. <br /><br />Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and JA, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.<br /><br />Phillipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, children are sacrificed in the name of ambition, as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCoulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices.<br /><br />Harrowing, panoramic, and vividly drawn, The Son is a masterful achievement from a sublime young talent."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["794012"],"name":["Philipp Meyer"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p5/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1232661317p2/794012.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/794012.Philipp_Meyer"],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["27766"],"text_reviews_count":["3775"]}]}],"published":["2013"]},{"id":[{"_":"18293427","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["1616203218"],"isbn13":["9781616206314"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"15246","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Storied Life of A.J.

His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island—from Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who’s always felt kindly toward Fikry; from Ismay, his sister-in-law who is hell-bent on saving him from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who keeps on taking the ferry over to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.’s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.<br /><br />And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It’s a small package, but large in weight. It’s that unexpected arrival that gives A. J. Fikry the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn’t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J.; or for that determined sales rep, Amelia, to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light; or for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.’s world; or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn’t see coming. As surprising as it is moving, <em>The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry</em> is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["40593"],"name":["Gabrielle Zevin"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1208386796p5/40593.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1208386796p2/40593.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40593.Gabrielle_Zevin"],"average_rating":["3.89"],"ratings_count":["213769"],"text_reviews_count":["28736"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"119324","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0679879250"],"isbn13":["9780679879251"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4165","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials, #2)"],"image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451271814m/119324.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451271814s/119324.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119324.The_Subtle_Knife"],"num_pages":["326"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":["First American Edition"],"publisher":["Knopf Books for Young Readers"],"publication_day":["22"],"publication_year":["1997"],"publication_month":["7"],"average_rating":["4.10"],"ratings_count":["253198"],"description":["<b>The most magnificent fantasy series since <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.” — The Oregonian</b><br /><br />Lost in a new world, Lyra finds Will—a boy on the run, a murderer—a worthy and welcome ally.

The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates.

Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.<br /><br />Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.<br /><br />Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher.

Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... <br /><br />Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok.

In \"Adventure Story\"--a thematic companion to <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>--Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience \"A Calendar of Tales\" are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the year--stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a Mother's Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> in his award-nominated mystery tale \"The Case of Death and Honey\". And \"Click-Clack the Rattlebag\" explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we're all alone in the darkness.<br /><br />A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent.

Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual’s place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed <b>War and Peace</b> in the same category as the <b>Iliad</b><i>:</i> “To read him . . . is to find one’s way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.”"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["128382"],"name":["Leo Tolstoy"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1450457558p5/128382.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1450457558p2/128382.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/128382.Leo_Tolstoy"],"average_rating":["4.02"],"ratings_count":["761921"],"text_reviews_count":["33867"]}]}],"published":["2002"]},{"id":[{"_":"13891","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["081257558X"],"isbn13":["9780812575583"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"991","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Winter's Heart (Wheel of Time, #9)"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13891.Winter_s_Heart"],"num_pages":["780"],"format":["Mass Market Paperback"],"edition_information":["First Mass Market Edition"],"publisher":["Tor Fantasy"],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.90"],"ratings_count":["71272"],"description":["Rand is on the run with Min, and in Cairhein, Cadsuane is trying to figure out where he is headed.

Now, the eagerly anticipated <i>Words of Radiance</i> continues the epic story and answers many of your questions. Six years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi. Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives. Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status \"darkeyes.\" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["38550"],"name":["Brandon Sanderson"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p5/38550.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson"],"average_rating":["4.36"],"ratings_count":["1677808"],"text_reviews_count":["111920"]}]}],"published":["2014"]},{"id":[{"_":"6695939","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"4","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Ysabel"],"image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"],"small_image_url":["http://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6695939-ysabel"],"num_pages":[""],"format":[""],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":[""],"publication_day":[""],"publication_year":[""],"publication_month":[""],"average_rating":["3.61"],"ratings_count":["7990"],"description":["Provence, in the south of France, is a part of the world that has been—and continues to be—called a paradise. But one of the lessons that history teaches is that paradise is coveted and fought over. Successive waves of invaders have claimed—or tried to claim—those vineyards, rivers, olive groves, and hills.<br /><br />In Guy Gavriel Kay’s new novel, Ysabel, this duality—of exquisite beauty and violent history—is explored in a work that marks a departure from Kay’s historical fantasies set in various analogues of the past.<br /><br />Ysabel takes place in the world of today: in a modern springtime, in and around the celebrated city of Aix-en-Provence near Marseilles. Dangerous, mythic figures from the Celtic and Roman conflicts of the past erupt into the present, claiming and changing lives.<br /><br />The protagonist is Ned Marriner, the fifteen year-old son of a well-known photographer. Ned has accompanied his father, Edward Marriner, and a team of assistants to Provence for a six week “shoot.”"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["60177"],"name":["Guy Gavriel Kay"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p5/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1218804723p2/60177.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60177.Guy_Gavriel_Kay"],"average_rating":["4.10"],"ratings_count":["149639"],"text_reviews_count":["8890"]}]}],"published":[""]}]
