Hi. I lead the [NPMap team](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/) for the U.S. National Park Service and live and play in beautiful Colorado.

## Projects

As a National Park Service employee, I've undertaken most of my latest work for the federal government. Take a look at the [NPMap website](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/) for more information about the National Park Service's digital mapping program. Most of the source code for the NPMap toolset is available in the public domain on GitHub:

- [NPMap Builder](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/)
- Places:
  - [Data](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-data/)
  - [API](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-api/)
  - [Editor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-editor/)
- [NPMap.js](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap.js/)
- [Park Tiles](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/park-tiles/)
