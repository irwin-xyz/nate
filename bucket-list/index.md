# Bucket list

Things I want to do before I die. This is a living list that's in no particular order. I was inspired to publicize the list by [Dustin Curtis](https://dcurt.is/bucket-list).

- Read a thousand books
- Climb Denali
- See the Northern Lights
- Ski in South America
- Ski in Japan
- Tour New Zealand in an RV (and bungee jump off a bridge!)
- Follow the path, from Paris to Madrid, of *The Sun Also Rises*
- Visit Tibet
- Visit Iceland
- Visit Hawaii
- Visit Ethiopia
- Get into outer space
- Complete a 50-mile trail run
- Have a kid and raise it well
- Speak in front of a thousand people
- Attend a Real Madrid vs. Barcelona soccer match at Camp Nou
- Buy a "vacation home" (ski house, beach house, cabin, etc.)... and vacation there
